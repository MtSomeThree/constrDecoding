0 Hello.
0 Hello.
1 Hello, good night. Who is it?
2 How about, uh, I'm William, how are you?
1 Ah Guillermo.
1 Yes
2 Ah, I'm Joseph.
1 What's up, where are you from?
2 Ah, I live here in Philadelphia.
0 Philadelphia.
1 Yeah, yeah, what about you?
2 This one, I'm studying at the University of Pennsylvania.
1 Ah, what are you studying?
1 Hey, I study history.
3 Ah I'm a student here too, I'm ah, senior
1 What college?
0 from, University of Pennsylvania as well.
0 Oh, yeah.
2 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll be done here soon.
0 Oh, that's good.
0 But what?
1 And what are you-- what are you studying?
3 Well, I'm in Wharton.
0 Hm
0 So, from, business yes and, but, then you're studying for it's, it's, ~PhD, it's Master's exactly what it is.
1 It's, uh, no, undergrad.
1 Ah, it's undergraduate ah okay, okay.
0 Hm mm Hm mm, hm mm
1 Ah, but you're here now.
1 Excuse me?
0 But you live in Peru then?
1 I'm sorry?
0 Do you live in Peru?
2 I mean, I lived in Peru, you've-- until three months ago.
1 Ah.
0 Sure, this one,
0 So you're fresh or
4 No, what happens is that I studied two years at the University of Peru, and then I transferred here. I mean, I'm an international transferer.
0 So you're not an exchange student, are you a transferer?
3 Of course it's, uh, uh, I mean, I'm, I'm graduating with a degree from this university.
0 Oh, that's good.
0 Unlike a, exchange student for example no.
0 Oh, that's good. So what do you think so far?
0 Hey, it's kind of hard to tell the truth.
2 Yes, but it's from English, or it's
3 And, n- well, English, English is actually a, let's say,
1 Everything, all the work.
5 It's a difficulty, I mean, uh, uh, I've, you've studied English a lot of my life, but anyway, it's harder for me to express myself in English than to express myself in Spanish.
1 Yes, yes.
1 No, I mean, that's, uh, very clear to me.
1 Yes
1 Uh, but aside, yes, for the amount of work I'm being sent, it's also a
0 More than Peru?
3 I do, I think I do, they send you more.
0 Mm.
4 More than in Peru. Even the last cycle, I in, in, in East Peru, at my university took six courses. Eh, a semester.
0 Hm mm
4 And, and even so, I think I had less work than what I'm having now, taking five courses.
0 Mm.
2 But, well, what happens is I'm giving five courses, but I also work.
1 Ah, okay, okay.
1 I don't know, all of a sudden that's the equivalent of taking six courses, something like that.
1 Yes, yes.
1 Suddenly it's a, a little less, I don't think it's as, as suing as taking six courses, but
2 Yeah, but I mean, it's still pretty intense.
3 I think yes, yes, I don't know, all of a sudden in the future I'll decide
1 Yeah, it's tough.
5 I-I, I, I'll decide to take less courses, I don't know. How many courses do you have more or less per cycle?
4 Um it depends. And I-and, in general, five but ah sometimes I say, ah no, it's just like four- but in the end, the last cycle just took four, but now I'm taking five.
1 Yeah, and, and, you
1 And, but in general, in, in college people only take four.
0 Right.
2 I think so, yes, but in Wharton in general people take five.
1 And besides you work, or
0 Hey.
0 Or do you do full time, your studies?
5 Yeah, I do, I have a little job there in the library, it's from Work Study, but it's uh, there, it's really not work because when I'm there,
0 study, then it's not like that
2 Oh, it seems very advantageous to me that, in what, to what, what do you do in the, I also work in the, in the library but I am a shelver
0 Mm.
0 So, it really doesn't give me a chance to study.
2 Ah, I sometimes did that but no but, in, which one are you, in which part of the library?
0 On the fifth floor of Van Pelt
0 Mm, okay, okay.
1 You, where do you work?
1 In Lippincott
1 Where's that?
2 It's, it's Wharton's library.
0 Right.
4 Yeah, it's on the second floor, mm, no, but, yeah, it's there, it's a good job because I just work, and I don't work so much work five hours a week, sometimes I work ten hours a week but
1 remains so, I do my homework, truth, then it is not so, there are, there are times, there are, already by the end, there is already a little more work, because
1 There are more people who need help, and everyone
0 Hm mm
1 He's doing his research, and in general, he's not enough, I don't have much work.
0 Hm mm
4 But here it is, uh- but what I've seen is that for example, I sometimes from ah, in Latin America, but you saw that in Europe,
0 at universities, you get for uh, because in general, there's not much work just until the end, right, so teachers
1 Oh, in-in England, for example?
1 Uh, yeah, in Europe in general, right,
2 Yes, I have also heard, that, that is, the amount of for example, of, the, the, the number of hours that what they take per course per week,
0 Hm mm
1 I think it's less than three.
0 Hm mm
0 So you have a lot of free time, so you don't have a lot of classes.
0 yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
4 And besides, I think you do, I mean, they don't give you much work, no, I'm not sure, no, no.
0 yes, well, then, they, then, no, they don't give him much work but uh, in general they want one, for it is assumed that, that one is
0 So, you're reading everything, you're doing exercises, and you're still doing all that truth.
0 Sure Hm mm, hm mm
1 And then in the end, they give one a test, and that's one's grade, but here in the United States it's
0 Because here, especially in history, you have to in-research, and then an essay, then something else, and another, and an exam, and
0 Hm mm
1 It's better in the sense than one, okay that, there are fewer risks, but ay
1 Yeah, sure, that, that, that, that, that, this, that's definitely an advantage, not true, that there are fewer risks.
0 the lock- yes, yes, but
0 Because, really imagine that for example, you were going to a, a, a, to decide your grade note on an exam. Suddenly the night before you couldn't sleep well, or
0 any could have happened, and all of a sudden
1 Yes
1 on the test you don't give up, I mean, suddenly you could've prepared quite a bit, but for ~X reason you didn't do well on the test, then
1 Yes
1 I mean, let's say the note
1 Yes
32 I know, I know, I know, I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't.
0 yes yes yes, no, but there is also but all the work they give to one, that is if every week one has one thing and another
0 another job, another job, then
1 Yeah, yeah.
0 each has its own system has its advantages. But, in, and in Peru how is it, in general?
3 I mean, I'd say they also make us work, I mean, we don't-- we kind of have the equivalent being midterms.
0 Hm mm
0 but which are mostly reading controls,
0 Hm mm
1 Uh, along, I mean, scattered, let's say, throughout the semester,
0 Hm mm
1 And for a few courses, not all of them, you are also asked, at the end of the course, to deliver an essay.
0 Hm mm
1 And besides, you also have a final exam, but let's say you don't have to produce as much as it does here.
0 Hm mm
1 I mean, you don't have to write that much.
0 Hm Hm mm, hm mm
0 Here he has you constantly writing, papers and reviews not true
1 Yes
0 Not so much back there, that is, more than you had to write it down, for example, you wrote it or on the test, or, or to deliver, that is, on the investigation.
0 Hm mm
0 But other than that, you didn't have to produce much.
1 Yes, yes.
3 And well, I mean, that could be seen as advantageous in the sense that you don't have, you don't have, you don't have tea, you don't have tea, you don't ask so much, you don't, I mean,
0 one can live a little more relaxed,
1 Yes, yes.
0 But the point is, the disadvantage is that you don't get there, you don't get to practice you, you don't, you're not in a constant practice of this work.
0 research, and not how to describe not true, that is sometimes one by not writing, so much, a little loses ease, not true, to write.
0 Hm mm, hm mm
4 That's what I'd say, I mean, more, it's easier, no, I mean,
1 Yes Hm mm, hm mm
2 It's easier, but I don't know if it's, let's say, if it suits you as well as they make you here.
1 Yes, yes.
2 But it has cost, that your form- that is, the, the cost is that a- here they make you better, okay, but at least, I, for example, this weekend, I'm full of things to do, so
2 You live a little longer, this one, at least, I live a little more anxious, let's say, a little longer.
1 Yes
0 stressed
1 Yes, yes.
3 But I don't know what it'll be like in Wharton I don't know.
3 It depends, because, for example, I say, the classes I took in general, they don't have
0 so essays, no research, only in general, two, three exams, and, and there it was. But there are classes for example that have more as well as, one has both exams, but also has projects.
0 Right.
1 These guys are like case studies.
1 And are products like that personal or in groups?
2 In, groups, in general, these days almost everything is in groups. And of course, they do give one tasks, things, things like that so that one is going through, because if not
2 because, and, and, and, and, I like it that way, for example, every week I have a task, little one has to deliver, because, that way,
1 You're forced to study every week, aren't you?
0 Sure.
1 But yes, that, that, that, I like, sometimes, they do that, but in general, they are exams, or projects.
0 Hm mm
3 Every class always has an exam, I don't, I've never had a class where there are only projects, right, but generally two exams, and maybe a project.
0 Hm mm, hm mm
2 In the, then, now in the marketing class we have a, a project that's like an uh, and- I don't know how they did uh, uh and
0 created an entire software which is like a simulation and then one, for example, each order as, there are like five orders, or six orders, then
0 One has a group.
0 Hm mm
1 And then everybody, each group gets one, one company.
0 Hm mm
0 So, one has several products, this company has several products, so one has to decide based on, of each product, well, where we're going, which kind of
0 co-co-how we're going to sell this product, we're going to
0 Oh, that's interesting.
0 placing more yes, yes, it is, that's how one, one is in a com- of course it's not like that in real life, but
1 But, I mean, it resembles at least something.
1 It helps you yes yes, it's not, it's not interesting but then, to ba- then already de- because when that ends, you have to write several as well, essays, do an analysis
0 of what one did, of the, of the mistakes, of what one did well,
0 Hm mm
0 So, there's a lot of things like that, too.
0 Hm mm
2 Uh, yeah, yeah, there's, and I almost don't write anything in general, so it seems a little weird to me that I had to write.
0 Right.
0 But, um and what else, and now, and the time here you du-- surely you don't really like it.
0 How?
0 Dema-it's too cold in here, isn't it?
1 Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1 Yes
7 I froze, yeah, I mean, I have to go with my jacket, I mean with my I-I have, I bought a jacket that is quite warm.
0 Na, yes.
4 And I have to, I mean, I always go out with her.
0 Hm
0 m- manageable matter no, d- inside the dorm this yes, if the temperature is, this, me- is enough
0 Pe-
0 Hot, no.
1 But in Peru, I was told that there are regions where it is very cold truth.
1 Well, sure, yeah, if you're gonna close this one.
0 Hm mm
2 Also in the evenings, especially, well, if you go in winter to the close, in, in winter, Eh, the winter nights of the closes are very cold yes.
1 Hm, I see.
4 I'd say until, I mean, I remember once, I'd have gone to the close of Peru, and that's it, on vacation with my family, and yes, at night.
2 I could make it even colder than I've experienced here so far.
0 Hello?
0 Hello, my name is Gloria.
1 Hi, Gloria, I'm Paulina, where are you calling from?
1 O- New York.
1 I'm in Georgia.
1 Long Island.
0 Oh?
1 Long Island
1 Long Island
0 Uh-huh.
2 I'm in Athens, Georgia.
0 Oh, Georgia, oh, my god.
0 Mhm. How's-?
1 I didn't understand what she said.
0 How?
0 Something about religion, she said she talks...
0 He didn't understand what he said.
0 No.
2 I was talking about religion, what is the opinion of religion, whether it unifies people, or if it separates them, whether they should all be of the same religion, or what do I know?
5 De- Ah, okay. Am, I am Catholic. So, I think, to my mind, am, they separate one and unite others. For example, I have a nephew who is gay,
0 So, they in the Catholic religion, they don't accept gays,
0 Uh-huh.
2 Because God didn't do them like that. But, if I remember when I was born, my nephew was born, a year old, we already knew that he, what he, he is going to do.
1 People don't think they're born like that, but he's a nation like that. And, just, and if you have someone in your family, it's that you know.
1 He has a lot of trouble with the Catholic religion because they don't accept it, and he knows they don't accept it, but he finally found a church in thirty-two in New York that accepts homosexuals.
2 Well, I think that, as far as religion is concerned, if people were to follow their religion, there wouldn't be as much trouble as there would be when those who put themselves at extremes, in whatever religion it is.
0 Mm-hmm.
1 If people followed, for example, those who followed Jesus Christ, if they followed the teachings of Jesus Christ, and if they acted as Jesus Christ acted,
0 Mhm.
1 It wouldn't be that much trouble.
0 Uh-huh.
0 But when they start peeling, that's not what he taught.
0 Mhm.
0 Jesus Christ.
1 Exactly.
0 where there's trouble.
0 Mhm.
0 Same thing with Muslims,
0 Mhm.
0 or the Jews, the principles of, of those religions and what they teach,
0 Mhm.
0 in itself, it is, it's good things, but when people get fanatical and don't accept other people, you respect differences,
0 Uh-huh.
1 I think that's when there's division, trouble.
6 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, this, what am I going to say? I, at lunchtime, I, the girls where I work, where I work, three,
4 I carry, this, a little book that's for Joyce Myers, and he, ah, everyday scriptures. And, I read them, so, they tell me, ah, that's shit, that, I say, but
1 Hear what she's saying, hear that you treat your neighbor well, like you, you'd like to treat yourself. Oh, no, I don't have to treat her well.
6 I don't like her, I say, but everyone is created in the image of God. Oh, we started fighting. So, I say. Look, I want peace, because what happens is of all things, and I, so I don't,
2 We talked about, about, about, about the theme of the day, but, forget it, it's been done, but I'm still wanted.
1 That's good.
2 Because, there's one that's like a firecracker, and I was already telling her that I don't want to hang out with her because she takes me away.
3 And, she's always criticizing everyone, and I don't want to, I don't want to be in that environment.
0 write five things that are grateful to God, uh, am, that you believe yourselves, forget. She always, oh, you are always reading some religion, that
6 I say, that's the only thing that saved my mind, if not, if I start to criticize, that everyone criticizes me, and I know that I am a good person, and that God I am as I am,
3 If I got carried away by people, I'd have thrown myself out a window by now.
1 Yeah.
1 And, that's what happens to her, they criticize her, so, she says, look, God loves you, and since you are, but you have, you can't be criticizing everyone.
1 And it's true, it's the same thing as...
1 Yeah.
2 in the relationship of one to one, or as I religate it- as a people, as, put yourself, what, what happens in Israel, among the
0 Uh-huh.
0 between the Palestinians and the Palestinians,
1 Yeah.
1 And the Jews.
0 Uh-huh.
1 It's sad, and they go by fighting.
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
0 Because for both there are sacred places, but they do not respect.
0 Uh-huh.
0 other people.
1 It's just, he, uh, uh, precisely the Catholic religion, everybody's going, like my friend went to another church.
1 this, this, and this, and the other, and I say, you have to find the church wherever you want, that you believe, that you conform, that conforms to you.
2 Or I'm not gonna tell you to go to the Catholic church, if it's not giving anything to you because I'm going to the Catholic church.
4 So, then, she me, she found another church, she tells me, maybe you should go with me, I say no, leave me where I am, I'm as good as where I am.
7 And, you know, I'm going to charismatic groups, so, so, I-I don't like going to other churches, I'm not gonna tell you that I'm not going, but I don't want her to co-
3 I've already been to that church, many times ago, and, and I've been limping all day Sunday, and I don't have all day Sunday to be there.
1 Three hours, four hours.
0 Oh, yeah.
0 Uh-huh.
1 What religion is it, is it your friend?
2 Ah, uh, I think Christian Science, something like that.
0 Oh.
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're like born again Christians, something like that.
1 Yeah.
3 Something like that, yes. So, then, you know, I, she was Catholic. But, the husband goes, to the, to the Catholic church. I, in my house, the only one who goes to church is me. My baby doesn’t like to go, I always fight with him to go.
3 And, he doesn't believe that God is helping him, I am, every day I tell him, you see, that God gave you, as today we were talking about
0 Katrina, and he says, oh, God did that, that,
0 Mhm.
2 And I couldn't convince him it wasn't God, that that was an act, you know, an act of god, as they say, but it wasn't
1 God Himself, that He does not leave those, although the Bible said that many things will happen like that. So, I was telling you, maybe reads the Bible, teaches you what is there.
1 Mhm. Yeah.
0 Mhm.
2 Yes, I find that, as far as religion is concerned, many people go nothing more by tradition, and
0 Uh-huh, yeah.
1 When you go and look for him, the truth,
0 Uh-huh.
0 and you really look, there you find a religion that,
0 Uh-huh.
0 But a lot of people who also go, just by tradition, but they don't even know what their own religion is all about.
1 Exactly, they sit there, and when the father finishes, they leave, they run.
1 Yes, or they don't study the scriptures for themselves, or anything.
1 Yeah.
2 Yes. It helps when you start studying, that what you believe is your own religion.
6 Like lately, I'm going to a charismatic group. So, I'm understanding more, even though they say it in Spanish, and I don't understand, I can speak Spanish, but I can't read it and I can't write it.
5 So then, they gave me a Hispanic Bible, and I, forget it, I'm reading it, but I don't know. So, I go and explain to them, I read this, and this, and this,
2 that's what, then, they read it in English to see if I can understand it. But, it becomes very difficult, the Bible is, is
3 The Bible, yes, the Bible is difficult. The vocabulary it uses, however, no matter what language, I find.
3 E-exactly, exactly. So, I find it very difficult, so, me, they give me some, some passes, and then I read it, and then, they tell me, this is this, and this, and this
3 You know, and, and they start to use it like in our lives, and, I say, oh, okay, so I get it.
1 Mm. Where are you from?
1 I'm Puerto Rican.
0 Puerto Rican. But did she grow up in the United States?
5 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I was born in Puerto Rico, but I grew up in New York, what the neighborhood says, in East, what the neighborhood says, in Manhattan.
1 Okay- I don't know.
1 You know, have you always been from Georgia?
1 No, I'm from Chile.
0 Oh, from Chile, ah, okay.
5 Yes. I grew up, and I grew up in Chile, and when I finished high school, I came to study at the university,
1 But I saw- Uh-huh.
1 America, here.
1 Ah.
4 And we've been here in Georgia, my husband and I, two years, but I've been in America, eleven years.
1 Wow, wow, wow, wow.
3 I lived in Wyoming for a few months. I lived in Utah.
1 Wow.
1 And, a year and a half in, in Maryland.
0 Uh-huh.
2 In Washington ~DC
0 Uh-huh.
1 And, now we're in Georgia.
1 Wow, you guys travel a lot.
0 dog, as they say.
1 That's good, that's good, move like that.
0 Uh-huh.
4 I lived in Manhattan, then I lived in the Bronx, and now I moved to Long Island and here we stay.
0 in Florida. Because, my child, my big boy and my grandchildren live in Florida.
1 Ah, then they're going to
2 So I'd like to go, I'd like to go to Florida to be close to them, but, from here to me, and my grandson, maybe he's married.
0 Because, he's seventeen years old, from here to my retirement he's ten years older, he's going to be twenty-seven.
0 Maybe somewhere else, yeah.
1 I'm gonna be one of the bis- l- Uh-huh.
1 Yes, we, from here, who knows where we're going.
1 Yeah.
0 Let's see, let's, my husband finishes his ~PHD
0 Uh-huh.
1 In two more years, and from there, where there's work.
1 Oh, where there's work. And what do you work there for?
2 Yeah, I'm in the house, with my kids.
0 Oh, he's in the house with his kids.
1 I've got two, two babies, one who's one year old, and the other who's three.
6 Oh, my god. yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Right? I do ni- party kids. I dress like a clown and now I'm trying to figure out how I can do Elmo's head.
1 Because, I have the, the bodysuit, but
0 Oh, yeah.
2 Then, me and she made party. So, sometimes they ask for two, and we couldn’t go. You can go only one.
1 Ah.
2 So there I am trying, my friend is doing it to me, but she's very heavy in her head. So, I can't even imagine how we're going to make that head.
5 So and, and through that, because, that's why I wasn't hearing what the lady was saying to me, because a tape from. And, I say, oh, I'm doing a lot of things, I must concentrate
1 All at the same time, yes.
4 all at the same time, because sometimes they call, and they don't call, and, and sometimes I catch it and I don't catch it. And, and they already had, they had given me this argument last week, I don't know why they argue the same thing.
0 Oh, yeah?
1 You know, you're doing it a long time, this?
4 Am, I've, I've done, I think ten, eleven.
0 Oh, like me, yeah.
1 Yeah, not so much.
0 Oh, okay, yeah.
2 But, last time, it was, what I did, it was politics. No, I don't remember what it was.
4 Ah, I found, I have a friend named Norma, I think she lives in Georgia too.
0 Oh, yeah?
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's Peruvian, Peruvian, yeah.
0 Oh, yeah.
2 Every time, I've talked to her four times already.
3 I think I've talked to her twice, I think.
1 Oh, yeah, I think she's from Georgia.
4 Yeah, from A-am, Atlanta, I think she lives.
2 Yeah, from Atlanta, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3 And I live in Athens.
1 Ah, in, ah.
1 In another city, yes.
1 Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, a niece of mine lived in Georgia but she moved. She still lives in Georgia, but she-she had to sell the house because she divorced the husband.
1 So, she had to sell the house and now she's alone. Yeah.
1 Who, no... your niece?
1 Yes, my niece, yes, she's about forty-something years old.
0 Uh-huh.
1 Yeah.
0 Halo, good night.
2 Good night, talk to Fabiola. Who am I talking to?
1 It's Lliorno from Philadelphia, how are you?
1 Okay, talk to Washington.
1 Ah, how are you?
1 Well, thank you, and you?
0 Good.
0 Um, today's theme is music.
1 It's the music you think of, and what kind of music do you like to listen to?
0 Joyful and romantic music as long as it speaks of positive love.
1 Why?
2 When, I don't like music when it talks about lovers or deaths or grocerías.
0 Or violence.
0 or violence, yes, not that.
2 Because? Yes, I like music too, exactly. Let it be positive music, other than negative music.
2 I like music with rhythm too I like to dance
0 OKay
0 Do you like to dance?

1 Excuse me?
2 And most of all live music, I like it a lot, too.
0 How?
0 Live music.
0 Live? Huh. Concerts like that?
0 Uh-huh.
4 Uh, uh, uh, not much, uh, I'd rather uh I, uh, what I do is that uh bu-, I'm looking for music online.
0 Okay.
4 so that, almost all the music has-, that I have the uh, I have, I have about five hundred ~C ~D that I bought and
0 Uh-huh.
2 many, are much more than I have searched the Internet
1 Exactly.
6 ah The way it stops, but for me, I mean it's for me, I need music for everything I need when I'm working, when I'm studying.
3 I always like to have music, it's what keeps me alert, I guess I'm ah mm. So for me yes, music, yes, extremely important.
1 And it's substantive.
1 Exa-
2 It helps me concentrate, it helps me relax, it helps me relax, I find, for me music can change my mood.
1 Exac-
3 Very quiet and yes I heard a song that could put me in a bad mood or I can still be in a bad mood and I can hear a song that cheers me up
3 Exactly, exactly, no yes, me too because I, no, uh, I play my instrument, and my husband plays his instrument and at least, uh, maybe some of it's festivals and stuff like that.
0 Okay.
1 There's a bar that's close to my house where a lot of people come to play every night nothing people feel anymore to, and to play instrument
0 and there are open circles every night and there are songs from, where people play and then the weekends come here different bands of music
0 to play every night of, on, on the weekends and it's fine cool.
0 Hey, what, what's your favorite kind of music?
1 I like everything.
0 Do you have any music you don't like?
3 At least I don't like it that way at least if rap hip hop I don't like it or at least music, ah, pop
1 So if Britney Spears and that don't, I don't like it, it doesn't catch my eye at all.
0 Okay.
3 I like, ah, I really like this at least rock in Spanish, I have lots of rock music in Spanish and bluegrass
0 Okay. So, what, does he have any favorite bands?
4 Well, I like it, at least rock in Spanish I really like Fito Páez
0 Okay.
1 what is from Argentina
1 Yeah.
2 Yeah, I like him a lot.
0 Okay.
4 And, uh, I music like that American. There's a gentleman who's called who's very good.
1 What?
2 And he who died ah that was also very, very good singing but at least around here, where I live, there are many people who touch
0 Oh.
0 many friends of us who play and sing and who have bands
1 Yeah.
1 And all the groups that they have are, they're very, very good too.
5 Okay. I-I mean, I don't mean, uh, I maybe you some-, to one or two gigs every year but I don't know.
2 Usually the kind of concert I'm going to is more uh, it's rock in, in English, and so uh, the people who are going are more like,
1 Well, young people, and it's kind of too scandalous, so, for that reason, it doesn't call me so much attention to go to concerts as such.
1 Ah.
3 Well, and I at least this year went to a, uh, Willy Nelson concert.
0 Uh-huh.
1 And Bob Dylan.
1 Yeah.
1 And there were people of all ages, and there were people of about sixty or seventy years old, and there were even children of thousands, eight years old at the concert.
1 Yeah.
1 Yeah, well, well, cool, they're in a small stadium in a, in a small baseball stadium and it wasn't, yeah, there weren't a lot of people but
0 But if it was very, very good the concert.
1 What, uh, you buy music or have many ~C ~Ds
0 More yes, more than everything we buy music but we also buy many musics from bands so, that they are not very popular, that is how people we know
1 Yeah.
1 Yeah, because we're members of one of, the, uh, Philadelphia folk music society, and then there's at least a lot of musicians there.
0 that they are members and do concerts in the houses and all that every month
0 Okay.
1 There's a concert in, in a member's house and we bought all those ~C ~Ds
0 Okay.
0 of groups that we see so that those who are not so super, super famous, but that yes, are good
0 Okay.
1 And sometimes we've, we've seen, at least groups that we do.
1 And
1 We knew we were famous and suddenly we're listening to it, we're at a festival or something.
1 Yeah.
1 And all of a sudden we hear a song that's famous.
0 Okay.
0 but
1 What, and the uh, you say you play instruments, uh, you're-- you're your husband playing like a band, a band?
0 No, no, no. My husband used to play in a band, because he's already that group, they're not together, maybe they're going, they're going to meet again.
0 Okay.
0 but no, we don't play for any group, or sometimes my husband who plays with his friends but what happens doesn't give us time, as much as for
0 to, to engage with people like this
0 Okay.
0 Because because of the work and that we don't, and, and then we don't give us time to compromise if, with a group because if you have a group, you have to practice at least one day
0 Practicing and searching for
0 week
0 promotions and
1 Yeah.
1 Yeah.
0 So, yeah, you have to spend a lot of time with him, and he, at least he's a group that wants my husband to play with them.
2 but where they meet, they gather on Wednesday night at about ten o'clock at night and then practice as long as two o'clock in the morning, on Wednesdays, and
0 how he has to work and, in school and that, doesn't give him time
4 Yeah. Oh, yeah, I, uh, I would have loved to have, uh, be able to play some instrument, but I'm lousy with that, but for me the
3 músi-, music that for me is good, well necessary. For me eh, I a-me, me me, ma fascinates, i mean, I am, I can be ah
1 I remember songs, lots of songs from
0 Mm.
3 songs that I can spend years without listening and at the moment the in-, uh I hear the, the song again and after years I can compla-, sing the full song
6 That happens to me, that I do spend a lot of time without singing a song to me I forget, but I, I was, the other time I was talking to a friend and
1 And we were with her, we heard a song on the radio that she hadn't heard for, like, eight years and she remembered the whole song.
4 And then they went through a song that I hadn't heard and about four years ago I hadn't heard it and I knew the song and
7 I knew I knew the song but I didn't remember the lyrics of the song, I remembered but a little bit, not much. I do forget if I don't, if I don't
4 If I don't listen to it all the time I forget the lyrics because of that, I know the song, but the lyrics forget a little bit.
4 Ah, well, I, to me, to me, it depends on, on, on, what mood I am in, I'm going, because that's what
6 Well, I, uh, I have an Ipod. You know what Ipods are?
0 Uh-huh.
1 Uh, for me then, uh, I have about ten thousand songs on, on, on the iPod.
0 Uh-huh.
2 and so I have everything, I have a, ah, a list of music that only has music for, de, de, de bai-, de dance dance music
4 I have a complete list that's, uh, just rock in, uh, in English that's, basically uh that's the one I use for, when I go to the gym.
1 Exac-
1 I have a list that's, uh, of music only in Spanish a list that's music that's just like classical music, opera, stuff like that.
0 for relaxation
0 Oh, and to study.
3 For me, to study I can't have that kind of music I can't have classical music, I need music
1 Yeah?
4 I have lyrics because I don't, if it doesn't have lyrics it's like I'm bored ne-, I need something that distracts me
1 What, what are you studying?
1 Hey, with- - I work with viruses.
0 Okay.
0 in biology
0 Okay.
1 So ta-, I always need something that distracts me, that, that keeps me-
1 Exactly.
2 Yeah, yeah, if I play music like that, it's not classic.
0 Mm.
9 I, I fall asleep I so- I have m-, I play classical music when I have many times when I have to uh, if I have to write a, a report that I have to concentrate a lot, a lot, a lot.
5 So, then, but always since I was little, always when I had to study, I was always listening to music and while I was singing, I could be reading and my dad would always criticize me that
2 It's impossible for a person to read and sing at the same time, but I don't know, it always worked for me, it always worked out good grades, so
1 Su-, I guess.
1 I had a teacher.
0 no
0 He said that when he doesn't, he's studying something so he has it, something you have to learn that if you sing it what you have to learn, you learn it more
0 Quick to that if you read it normal
4 Yeah, that doesn't appeal to me, I'm not attracted to anything. The, the music, I mean, uh, a can.
0 Hello, hello.
0 Hi, you're talking to Fabiola.
0 and they connected you and so it worked
1 And that's how it works, and you get paid.
0 Oh, look at that, too.
1 great or not. and that's the subject I told you to talk about and so a conversation topic.
1 Then you have to talk about memories.
0 about the best thing that's ever happened to you.
0 ah
0 and how your life has changed
0 Okay.
1 And what's the best thing that ever happened to you?
0 ahh artas things
0 But the best you feel has ever happened to you.
1 Ahh.
1 That's a good topic.
2 Yeah, I know someone with these kids.
1 Yes
2 I think it all starts knowing someone because if I hadn't met him,
2 Yeah, I say the same thing.
1 These kids wouldn't be here.
0 Uh-huh, the best thing that ever happened to me was meeting my husband.
2 Yes, because I eat
1 And the second and the other better thing that's happened to me is having my kids.
1 Yes
0 be healthy be healthy
2 For, yes, because if I had known the child, no, I would not be here.
0 and actually
2 I wouldn't have these kids. No, I wouldn't know you either.
1 Yes
0 if it wasn't for him or
2 Why? It's okay with the good songs that you find good conversational topics when you talk around here because you also get the music yesterday there was the music
1 Yes
0 Uh, yeah, and it's entertaining, you talk 12 minutes and they cut you off themselves.
1 Hey, I like them.
0 if they tell you you have thirty seconds left to say goodbye
0 Ohh.
1 And so we have twelve minutes to talk about whatever we want because they're recognizing our you.
0 But what's the name of this? Don't talk about what they tell you.
1 You have to talk, you have to talk about what they tell you or what you want, the idea is to talk because that's all this, the whole conversation is being taxed.
0 ah so that later the computer knows what eh
1 Who's who?
0 and for him, for the accent
0 by the accent, the system, uh the way to talk and
0 mm
0 the bells of you and something are inventing

0 they look and laugh and say hey you look like me, no no no you look like me
1 And one of them is that they have the pacifier tied to the bib so he throws the pacifier to the pacifier he's got holding him like this.

0 ah
2 Now I speak a better English, Michel speaks a better Spanish and already she can read the two languages and it is already better but they do get confused when the dad
0 speaks with an accent and a strong accent
5 I mean, the bad thing I'm doing, I'm talking to them in Spanish, but the bad thing is, for example, when I'm with someone else and they speak English.
3 I speak to them in English I understood
0 But isn't that bad?
0 'Cause no, but it's still wrong 'cause no, 'cause my accent isn't understood.

0 hmm, every year we go a week.
1 Oh I Cristina told you the other time that they were thinking of going to Chile for the job
0 Oh, yeah.
1 And that's why it didn't work out for them.
0 No, but it doesn't start after yet.
0 but he told me that maybe not and the whole thing that
2 Of course, but maybe it's not true that I don't, and it's not true that I do.
0 mm
1 They told him he's here, they've got the staff in case of anything they're gonna let him know.
1 Yes
1 It's what we call you later.
0 a thing like that.
0 but it turns out that work in Chile is not yet beginning
1 Ahh.
4 There's still, I hear I'm excited too I tell Michel, Michel if we get out we're leaving
0 He'd leave.
0 Michel did, but...
0 m
1 I'm telling you how we're going to go if we just bought the house, how?
0 Hey.
1 We sell it then and it makes me laugh because for him it is as easy as it is just to get rid of, take things and get rid of them.
1 And it costs me so much work.
0 'Cause it took you a lot to find the house anyway.
5 Yeah, after I put it together, I tell you I still don't put curtains on it. Those curtains are slowly coming in.
0 Huh?
1 We bought them by JCPenny
0 m
2 They are slowly coming if first came some curtains, last night I got another part, a bread the top
0 Huh?
5 Then I got the other side of the top and I'm still missing I've got, I'm missing three more curtains that have to come and they haven't arrived
1 And are those the curtains in the living room or?
3 The one in the living room because I didn't put them I didn't put them eh how to say, perciana
1 You didn't put them on?
1 Not because the rest of the house I put percianas but the living room not because the windows are not windows, they are windows
1 Ahh.
0 So they don't exist that size unless you order them to make one exclusively for that.
0 especially for
0 Hey,
0 Hello.
1 Who's talking?
1 My name is Anny.
3 Hi Anny, I'm Arthur.
1 Hello, Arthur.
1 Where are you calling from?
0 From Miami
1 Miami, very well I'm talking about
1 Where from?
0 Philadelphia
0 Philadelphia
1 Yeah, where are you from?
0 Hey, Puerto Rican.
0 Oh, okay.
1 What about you?
1 I'm Mexican.
0 ah,
1 Yes
1 Are you studying here in the United States?
1 Yes, exactly.
1 That's good.
0 Do you study or work?
2 No, uh, I have a girl of twenty-three months and I have a boy now of four days.
0 Oh, hey, that's nice.
1 So, no, I'm working but no.
1 Yeah, well, sure.
0 Not outside the house.
2 Yeah, sure, a lot of work in the house I imagine.
1 Yeah,
2 That's good But very happy I guess not,
1 Yes, a little tired now but very happy
1 Yeah, four days he's got the kid.
0 Four days
1 Wow little bit.
1 Yeah,
1 How young Hey and this, then why do you live in America? Have you lived there all your life or?
1 Yeah, uh, my parents are from the Dominican Republic.
0 Okay.
2 And in nine hundred and seventy-something, I don't know exactly when it was
0 mh mhm
3 Ah, I think it was sixty-three, I'm not sure.
0 mhm
0 But a Revolution in Santo Domingo
0 Okay.
1 And they went to live in Puerto Rico
1 Ah, okay.
1 Then they spent twenty-two peaks of years there.
0 Uh-huh.
0 So from there, my sister when she went to college came here to the state of Florida so we moved to Miami.
1 Ah, okay.
3 And I was like I think it was five years.
1 Ah, very small.
1 Yeah, my sister takes me ten, eleven years.
1 Ah, okay.
1 Then from there we, you know, stay and
1 Yeah,
1 Uh, me, I went to school here and you know we made a life here.
1 Yeah, yeah, sure.
1 And
2 And right now you're married to, is it Latino, or an American?
2 An American
1 Oh, okay, I see.
2 Yeah, I met him at the university.
2 Ah, okay this one over there in, in Miami I guess
1 No, uh, I went to
0 Oh, okay.
1 In
0 Okay.
2 Then I met him there.
2 Ah, I see, all right,
1 Then
1 And
0 after, ah
1 And what, and what language you speak with, with this, with your, well, right now you don't even speak, your children true because
0 Okay.
0 She's twenty-four months old. Not the other one.
0 Uh, the, uh, she's 23 months old and the other one's four days old.
0 twenty-three, yes, not because it is
1 I what we do that when he's not, in, my husband is not in the house
0 mm
1 I speak completely Spanish to my daughter
0 Okay.
1 So when he's here, we speak English completely.
1 Ah, okay.
1 And so she can know with both languages
0 recognize them,
3 And, and I, I get surprised because many times she says things
0 Oh, yeah.
2 that I didn't even realize that I already learned
0 Oh, really.
2 It can be in English or Spanish
1 Wow aha,
0 So he's already fucking her.
0 Very fast
1 Yeah,
3 Also not, I mean how old children start talking normally, I don't know the truth
2 And I think it was, she had, let's say fifteen, sixteen months.
0 Okay.
2 As she is learning English and Spanish
0 Uh-huh.
1 Hey, he takes the kids who do that. It takes them a little more time to talk.
1 Yeah, yeah,
0 So my girl got caught by you know, her friends and whatever, the little friends.
1 Yeah,
0 Hey, they talked more clearly and more than she did.
1 Yeah,
1 Ah, until recently.
0 ah,
3 So now she, I knew she was, I understood and I could talk.
1 Yes, but
0 But since he had both languages, it made him a little more difficult.
1 Of course, it has to be much more difficult but, because I think, well in the long run it's going to be very good too no, so growing up with languages is an advantage
1 Yeah, yeah.
0 the truth
1 So uh, but, you know, she, I know she understood.
0 mm
3 What I was telling you in English and Spanish
2 Yeah, yeah, I guess so.
3 And now, you know, especially I know she understands me because when she doesn't want to do something like goofy and I know,
1 Yeah,
2 I see her face and I know she understands me, exactly.
1 Yeah, sure, but the kids are very clever then, then, no,
1 Yeah, yeah,
1 You know.
0 So, but you know, she understands, she talks about it,
0 mm
1 And
4 Well, if you wish and hold on to it, because then this one already when it starts to grow more and and many of your friends speak English because they're going to practice English more I don't think so.
2 Yeah and no, uh, we're not gonna send her to school, if not I'm gonna show her to the house,
1 Ah, okay.
2 Because I am, I was a teacher.
0 ah,
4 Then I think that for me to go to work and teach the You know, children of someone else, that's why I stay in my house
0 Uh-huh.
2 And I can teach my own children
1 Yeah, that's true.
0 So...
0 But, but, and what do you think he means he's not gonna have as schoolmates, that, that's...
0 Okay.
1 That's not an experience, too, you know.
1 Yeah, they have a lot of shows here in Miami, for the people that their kids teach in the house.
0 Uh-huh.
0 So uh, usually once a week, they get together.
1 Ah, okay.
0 So it's like a school, it might be that, uh, we have to say the class at a church or at a college, whatever, but it's like a school that meets once a week.
1 Ah, okay.
1 So, and also you know, with his friends and all that, I have a lot of friends and families that have done that.
0 on
0 mhm, and, and they don't have any problem
1 Ah, okay.
0 you know, but it's also not something that
1 Yeah,
1 Because that one to me, that worries me too, I want her to have friends and friends and all that.
3 Yeah, of course that's what I was thinking because, yeah, I mean, it's part of the experience, no, of being in a school that you know people.
1 Yeah, yeah,
1 So I think that too, that's important, is that no, it doesn't need that when you're a kid, because the truth is your friends are very important.
1 Yeah, yeah.
1 I don't think so.
1 Yeah, yeah,
0 But yes, as long as you have contact with other people, it's at least a week, but...
1 And also you know, they have sports the, uh, the, uh, like community sites.
1 There's a lot, there's a lot of community input here, truth and that.
1 Yeah, so you know, things like that are like they know how to say, so they socialize.
2 Yeah, I see.
0 So, you know,
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1 Yeah,
5 So I don't know people like I've left those kind of schools, you understand me, and I'm always very curious about how they do it here in America, because here if I know it's much more common, there are a lot of people who
1 He's out of school. Oh, well, at least before now I don't know anymore.
1 Yeah, uh, the, that you know, it's like any other experience, it's how you take it, you know, it can be good it can be bad
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1 But I also think that as are the schools here, also as are the boys
1 It can be very bad too, right?
4 Yeah, I'd like her if she had you know, friends and all that stuff, but at the same time I think I have to protect her.
1 Yeah, sure, but you have to be careful because then it's bad about protecting them.
1 Yeah, yeah.
1 It can be very bad.
4 Yeah, not me, but that's why I want to teach him because I can teach him anything, but it depends how I know the present
1 Yeah,
1 You know,
1 Yeah, yeah.
1 It's a little different than, let's say how to introduce him to the school.
2 Yeah, that's true. And until the grade you plan to give him the home school in your
2 Uh, I don't know. Uh, I haven't thought of anything yet as being two years old.
1 Yes
2 And I haven't started.
1 In time you will see that
1 Yeah, so...
0 But like you think, you mean to give him the whole grade school or what?
1 ah, it would probably be up to, until I know, at least the sixth grade.
0 Okay.
5 Then from there, then we'll see we'll go on because I don't know you know, I, I with my I can teach her until High school
0 Oh, yeah.
0 ah,
0 Do you mean you have, have you taught high school or what?
1 Yeah, yeah,
1 And in what matters more than anything
1 Uh, well, my, I was a special education teacher.
0 Uh-huh.
1 So I taught everything
2 Ah, okay, I see.
3 So I know, the only thing I do, if I don't know anything.
0 Uh-huh.
3 If I don't understand the subject or whatever, then I teach myself to be able to teach children
1 pray to him, okay, I see.
0 So you know, like things like we're gonna say algebra.
0 mm
2 Not that I don't know, but it may be more than I forget.
1 Yeah,
1 Because I don't use it.
0 Uh-huh.
4 So uh, you know, I, like before I taught class, what I was doing was I kind of reminded myself
0 mm
2 Which was what I had to do.
1 Yeah, sure.
2 Then I could teach them
1 Ah, okay.
1 So for me that's not very difficult, I know that for someone else it may be that yes but for me
2 Yes but, as well as because I say already in high school as they begin to specialize more materials and chemical is more advanced and physical is more advanced
2 And also this time, I know that now
0 Uh-huh.
1 They have even classes that, that children can take or students that can take on the computer
1 Yeah,
2 And you can go to one, a high school let's say on the Internet
1 Yeah,
0 So you know, there's a lot, a lot, a lot of options that's not just about
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1 You know, you have to
1 Yeah, no.
0 that put him in a public school as well
0 mhm
2 You know, I know the colleges here.
0 mhm
1 They have uh, classes for kids too, in high school they can take at the university.
2 Yeah, I heard about that.
0 So you know, we have a lot of options.
0 Very good. Very lucky.
1 And that
1 But if as you say too, I mean she's barely two years old. Not yet you don't have to think too much about it.
1 No, but as my husband says, you know, I'm a teacher.
0 Uh-huh.
2 I'm always reading him books, I'm, you know, singing songs.
0 mhm
0 So she's not, you know, so she's having fun, but at the same time she's not, uh, she's always learning something.
1 Yeah, okay.
1 So you know I'm not giving her formal school.
0 Okay.
2 But if I'm giving her or I'm educating her
0 mhm
0 Little by little, she knows the alphabet, well she knows the song
1 Yeah, you read.
1 Yeah, uh-huh, so you know uh, the numbers.
1 Yeah,
3 A little bit I, you know, if I tell her one she can tell me two, three, then the next one tells me, she already knows eight comes after seven, you know things like that.
1 Yeah, you know the order.
1 Yeah, not all, but little by little.
1 Yeah, that's good.
0 So you know, like this.
1 Yeah, it sounds, it sounds pretty interesting.
1 Yes
7 That I don't know anything, I don't know how Osea if I was in that situation, I don't know how I would do it because I would never imagine how
4 I couldn't teach my son, because I'm also telling the truth. I'm not that good. Uh, no, I didn't have an education as to how to teach, you know.
0 mhm
2 I imagine you must have studied something like Education or something, right?
1 Well, this one.
0 Or what did you study?
2 I studied if education but I wasn't taught exactly how to teach we're going to say how to teach a child how to read
1 Yeah, no.
3 All those things I had to learn when I was working
0 Uh-huh.
1 So I'm using the experience.
0 Of course, of course, you got all the schools to teach.
1 Yeah, but for that reason, it's just, you know me, for me to do it with me with my kids.
0 mhm
3 It's no problem because I already have the experience, I don't know, you know how other people do.
0 My name is Mariza
3 Hello good afternoon, my name is Lorena. I'm here in San Antonio, Texas.
0 Hello.
0 Hello, uh, so today's theme is most touching.
2 Yes, I've had a hard time thinking about what's best and what's best but
2 exactly, right now I said good is going to be memories, I said good memories are like precisely the most important thing that can happen to one in life, because one lives, like memories, no
3 exactly, with so much, uh, with so-- and I don't know how much more time goes by, more memories there are, I don't know, I wouldn't even know what to choose to start with.
0 ah
0 for example the best
2 That's right, the best good I'm mom
1 Yeah, me too.
6 And maybe yes, if I want to think about the best thing that's happened to me, maybe that's it, having my kids, I remember the moment I was having them I said, this is the best thing that's ever happened to me so I want
0 Of course.
2 I want to be consistent let's say with that comment that I made to myself at the time that was happening but yet there must also be other things
0 wonderful and maybe you can't just select one true
0 Of course, that's what he was thinking, and he was also asking that if that hadn't happened as his different life would have been, in his case if he hadn't had his children.
2 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I wouldn't have liked it.
1 It's, it's
0 because, because now they are great they have brought me good so many beautiful things, not that perhaps myself on my own would not have been enough to give me so many memories and so many
2 positive and negative emotions, then also because not everything is beautiful, not I have precisely because I have a son who, who has some pro, a health problem and that is also very painful, no
1 Yes
1 And, and good this but yet are the most perhaps loving and tenderest and most uh-good emotions and there's the husband, right, the husband
1 Yes, and it is not yes, but the children, the children.
1 That's got a lot, a lot to do with it, too.
1 Yes
0 in, in one's life, no and this
0 no
2 But if I did, I'd think it couldn't be anything more than just one event.
0 Of course.
0 now a painful event, a painful memory as my mother's death for example
0 Of course, the death of a relative or a loved one has to be the worst thing that can happen to someone.
1 Yes, yes, or my son's illness, too, not that too.
0 also
2 It's very painful, but as I say, you can't say that just one, but it's nice to try to think about it, no.
0 clear as the second part of the question, was that what, that would have been of the, of his life that did not, had not happened that, that negative or painful echo
0 Uh, yeah.
2 I mean, I wouldn't be serious that that person would be right now, for example, in my case, my mom lives, but my, my grandparents have both passed away a long time ago.
3 And I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to them or because I lived far away, so maybe it would have been if it had been if my life had been different, if not because of course they couldn't meet my husband or my daughter either.
1 Then yes.
1 Exactly, exactly mhm.
0 Of course, life would be very different.
0 Mhm your husband. Did you meet him where?
0 here in the United States almost by chance
0 Uh-huh, 'cause you're Spanish.
3 And I am, I'm Spanish.
0 Uh-huh, yeah.
4 And I came here to study with the studio but I met him and ended up staying and I've been here twelve years.
0 Uh-huh.
2 and nothing I have a five-year-old daughter, that's I couldn't tell her well my life has changed, of course, because the children change one's life, but she's so small that she still has so much left
2 Yes, of course I do.
3 And then nothing, I don't know, is different when the children are older, they do become more independent, but I still have to go through that.
1 Yes, yes, and, and really, there are so many things and so many stages.
1 And of course,
0 this but good this age when they are little is one of the most loving
2 Yeah, yeah. Everybody tells me the same thing.
0 mhm is one of the most loving and good already when they grow up and make their life on their own, for example because it is nice but no longer receives one like the
2 Today, Mom, because it went very well for me, it's me, and I hear Mom, because it's already like this at conversation level, like at level.
1 There's not that much dependence, there's not that closeness like that.
1 Yes
0 this one but it's very nice, the truth is very nice and then for you what would have been the best thing that happened to you, the best memory
6 Well, I think you, the same as you, the, the having kids, uh, well, I just have one, and I don't think, I don't know if I'll have any more.
0 Uh-huh.
4 It was no, I mean I didn't think I was ready to be a mother maybe because it was a big change and ah the pregnancy was difficult and he, ah
2 He, we raised her, my sea- my husband and I here alone, then it was a little difficult but it was also clear to have a child to one changes life, then it is the best then that has happened to me I say
0 For now
1 Yes
2 Uh, I don't know. You can compare anything to that.
4 Yeah, right, that's what I've been right now, too, I thought that if I kind of had a good time, you have a nice memory in life of the accomplishments you had.
0 Of course.
0 as a person, in sports in or in academic life or at work, no
1 of course and, and that's why, the other question was that it would have been different if it hadn't happened maybe if I hadn't been a mother because my life would be very different.
1 Maybe I'd have finished my studies.
1 That's right.
0 Of course, getting a more important career, or seeing someone else traveled more or known, but of course you never know that one can imagine only.
0 exactly, exactly and yet how one is accumulating
1 Yeah, but...
0 memories in photographs of Christmas and in photographs of festivals at school and in photographs of sports festivals of children
0 Oh.
1 It's just like, going around putting this life together because it's made of memories, no.
2 Yes, all the photographs I have are thousands and thousands, they're all from the, from me they're all from my daughter, so of course, the
5 It's easy to say it's the most important thing, eh because other than that of course, apart from that because I don't know, I've traveled a lot, I've met interesting people but I don't know can compare with
2 With the kids, I guess.
0 mhm yes because this is as well as very, as very complete as very you do not study to be a mom, you do not study to be
0 no
0 human being is not studied to learn to love but finally it is the deepest and most complete emotion, not
3 Yeah like I tell my sister she doesn't have kids and I tell her, until you're mom you're not gonna know how to be a woman let's say more
1 complete because they have, they have been married for twenty years but no, they have no children, I don't think they will have, and then it's hard to explain
1 It's hard to explain.
2 It's very hard to explain. You're not as they say.
2 but, but one says it's nice that I did, because I wouldn't have liked to miss it.
6 yes I had it for that because I say I turned thirty, and I say already well I think it's time that or now or, or, or we have one now or older I don't want to have it because
1 To raise a child, you have to have a lot of patience, a lot of energy, and a lot of
1 A lot of energy, that's right.
0 of all yes, yes and my daughter who is eh yes requires much patience and much sacrifice
0 Uh-huh.
0 and
1 Yeah, yeah, actually, and she, for example, because, because she's very naughty,
3 She's very active, very hyper-active and I don't know she's not a girl like I was when I was little, she was rather quiet, and more so she did everything my parents told me, she didn't, she's more
0 She's one like three, sometimes she's
1 Yeah, yeah.
1 I end up tired, after every day, but well, she's like that, she's like that, you have to accept the kids as they are.
1 That's right, yeah, yeah.
0 and
1 And this one and then you understand a lot about why they're like this and everything that's going to allow them to achieve having a strong and very active character, no.
4 If I do that's what I think, or I hope she does.
1 She's gonna accomplish a lot of things I think.
3 Yeah yeah, I compare it to my niece, who are so different, I think my daughter doesn't know, she has a stronger character maybe that will help her in the future to get through better
1 Yes, with, with all the difficult things that stand in front of him, the challenges
0 Of course.
1 No, I have a daughter who's a little bit like that and she's also very good at school issues because she's an excellent sportsman.
2 Yes, that's what we want, we want my daughter to play some sport too, but we want to expect her to get older because at five I don't know maybe she's too small but
0 she's got the body to say to be a sportsman and maybe that'll help her develop more and
0 to his character to be able to too
1 Yes
0 like to orient, not mhm
1 And, and maybe he'll calm down.
0 and to be tired
2 Yeah, I do because sometimes we go to sleep before she, we can't sleep anymore.
1 Yes, yes, they do need to get tired, that barbarity.
1 I don't know if they tell me it's age
1 Where do you live?
1 We're in Philadelphia right now.
1 ah in Philadelphia, I have my oldest daughter studying at Pennsylvania University in Philadelphia.
0 Oh, what a coincidence, it's a good college.
1 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
0 yes, yes here is a city where many people come to study, many young people one of the most important, that that is another thing also important, education
1 ♪ And now ♪
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2 Of course I'd like my daughter to go to college too, but I still have a lot of years left for that.
2 Yes, but of course he's going to. What did you study?
2 I criminal justice good psychology but I didn't finish the race
0 Uh-huh.
2 Well after I get pregnant, the girl, we want to raise her at home we don't want to take her to a daycare because we don't want to know it's the most traditional way, like they raised me, they had me in every dad, they took care of me,
0 mhm, mhm
0 we don't want to leave her alone on a daycare so in the
1 That's a good decision.
1 Yeah, yeah, it's good.
2 I support it. You have to take a lot of vitamins to have all the energy you need.
0 yes as long as you can, now already yes, yes, yes and
2 And you'll see how when more time goes by I already have my youngest daughter turned fifteen yesterday
1 Wow.
0 then already when, when you see back you have even more memories, many more memories more experiences of all the achievements also of it, which are yours because
1 They achieve things thanks to the support that parents can give them and the delivery of so everything that you are delivering, not as you say good because you are leaving aside
0 Maybe your most personal thing, your career, your profession.
1 Yes
4 Well, my name is Claudia Ivette. Who do I like?
0 Hello, my name is Juan.
0 Oh, nice to meet you, John.
1 Nice to meet you anyway. Where are you?
1 Where from, Mande?
1 Where are you?
2 Uh, I'm here in Idaho state.
0 Uh-huh.
1 Where are you talking about?
4 Ah okay I'm in Texas, in San Antonio
1 Wow, a little bit retired.
1 Uh-huh. We're out there. Mm-hmm.
1 Yeah, well, you see, it's been a while since we've had the subject of the movies.
0 No, yes.
4 Well, I'm a lot of that sorting thing. I don't understand much. I know there are movies that are ~PG thirteen ~PG.
0 Uh-huh.
2 And the truth is that I've seen some that really have more groceries that are ~PG tre- eh are more like more violent and more
1 More so are those of the ~PG the ~PG than the ~PG thirteen I have noticed
0 Uh-huh.
2 Then I don't understand much about it.
1 For mhm notice that I have not heard much of those, of those classifications.
0 Uh-huh.
1 I end up not understanding them either.
0 Uh-huh.
1 I think they're, uh, a little bit complicated, rather they should have a little bit more information that's what they have.
1 Yes, that's right.
2 I don't usually like I don't have little kids anymore.
0 Uh-huh.
1 I don't care much.
0 Uh-huh.
1 For those classifications I care more anyway, for when we're going to watch a movie that's a worthwhile movie, that has something of interest and not go to any movie then the classification
0 Uh-huh.
2 I don't care as much as the quality and comments I hear about movies, no
0 Uh-huh.
2 That's what catches my attention a little bit, it's-- I don't know if it happens to you the same thing, you always go with yourself or you go with someone.
4 I'm not married, I'm three years married, and the truth is, I have, a boy, he's 20 months old.
0 Uh-huh.
1 So he's barely gonna be two years old, and if the truth is, I'm worried about what we do, well, my husband more than anything.
0 he for example if we watch some movie and we really love it, we like the movie for example if it's ~PG or ~PG thirteen
0 Uh-huh.
1 Which is what we see the most, we don't really like him or me watching adult movies.
0 Uh-huh.
0 up to ~PG thirteen
0 Oh, yeah.
0 this one or sometimes another one ~R but the truth doesn't catch our attention but for example if there's a movie we like
1 Yes
1 We buy it and it has for example sometimes they have some nude scenes and that the ga- my husband grabs, puts the movie and erases that part
0 ah
2 And he does it more than anything because for example they're going to see occasions when neither my husband nor I are going to be then because then the kids can grab the movie and they can watch it.
1 And in that my husband is going to record some commercial or something.
0 Uh-huh.
1 Then you can really watch the movie because it won't see, better it can be pure of cars or action.
1 Yes
0 But for example it takes away, it erased the part that is that it is a bit pornographic, because since always while it is a good movie there must always be a nude.
1 Yes
1 And sometimes it has nothing to do with it.
1 There's always something
1 We have movies that are action and cars and all of a sudden something comes out that up and that has nothing to do with it but
1 Yeah, it had nothing to do with it, yeah.
1 Then he's what he's done for because we're gonna have other kids so they're gonna be alone in and so we can rest assured that if they watch a movie then
0 he's not gonna see any trouble, but
2 Yes, yes, I think that in that sense you can be quite right.
1 Yes
1 Ah to me eh notice that curiously
0 Uh-huh.
1 What worries me most in movies is language and violence.
1 Uh, yeah, 'cause I really do.
0 regularly because as you say when there is an exaggeration in language
1 Yes
0 or in violence everything else is, the same
1 Yes
0 So when the movie is like this ~R because obviously it's going to have scenes of all kinds like this.
0 No, yes.
1 Those are free, so rather ~R seems more than restricted seems like you don't have a lot of information about the movie is exaggerated in all the elements.
1 Aha no yes and apart for example we have found movies that are for this for children or this are not for children but to see are
0 passing from that of children who is uh supposedly the ~PG thirteen which is for thirteen-year-olds who can see it then but sometimes, they say as you say vocabulary and sometimes they pass scenes
1 naked and that, then I say ay how you're going to see, well
1 Yes
2 I don't know. I'm Mexican.
0 mhm
2 This one and really there for example still ah like still on TV they still take care of you and even in the movies they still take care of you like a little bit that
1 Yeah, well, look at that.
4 But I mean, ah, I don't know, I don't know I get very
0 making memory of the films we've been watching lately, as they're all
0 very fast mhm
1 ~PG thirteen or something like that I don't know where he grabbed it because the ones we have here
0 Uh-huh.
0 available in cinemas
0 Uh-huh.
1 They're, they're not just good.
0 No, yes.
0 So no, we worry a lot about that information as my kids are already teenagers we always go to the movies all together but
0 Uh-huh.
0 Let's go more than anything for the quality of the film then
1 Yes
0 the, the in that sense the classification that they have here to guide us on the film, because it is not really gives information, no
0 sometimes he doesn't tell you anything, because sometimes for example he tells you
1 We don't take it into account.
1 And, and it changes things, for example, and when you're already seeing it, it's, like, different than what it says to you.
0 Uh-huh.
0 Oh yeah for example it tells you that it's too violent sometimes it's not so violent, just not sometimes no no, it doesn't really say the information
1 So sometimes I don't.
0 Uh-huh.
0 Neither one of them listens to him better because he doesn't and those for example.
1 Yeah, no.
0 those things they sell for example to sell on television sets that they already see this one
0 that
4 I mean, sometimes they work, but sometimes they don't, it doesn't work out that much that I say I rea- well I really don't have one.
1 But I have a friend who has one and really tells me no, it hasn't worked much because sometimes it covers the grocerías that ah, words that aren't so grocerías and the grocerías leave them.
1 Yes
0 then uf
0 Notice that aha, in that case when we for the children's education
0 Uh-huh.
1 We've never done an act, we've done censorship, we've never done anything.
1 Yes
1 What we have tried is when there are scenes that are strong we try to comment them, not
1 Yes
1 We comment them and we say if it was because regularly it is when we worry and we say listen that is left over, it has no case to have put the language is very ugly
1 Yes, yes.
0 No, we analyze it, and then we take advantage of it as part of the children's education.
1 Yes
1 In general it works very well for us because or it worked for us, not anymore, now they are already grown
1 Yes
1 And what happens at this point, is that you have very good judgment about movies not, and
2 If you notice that it is true, that's a better idea I remember my mom when we watched a movie, maybe we didn't see a movie after ten o'clock at night because
1 We already knew we'd be able to find
0 Uh-huh.
0 Or my mom would risk finding ugly movies.
0 Uh-huh.
2 of a kind that is no longer suitable for some children, but for example sometimes I said, they didn't pass a movie and I don't know any other rudeness
1 Yes
0 or something that's not so naked but the same, for example, little clothes and when we were girls for example my mom
0 Uh-huh.
0 no daughter for you will understand more and tell us.
1 Yes
0 Because also so then if you say don't turn around, you don't have to see that then like a teenager or a child, it starts coming in, ah but why doesn't my mom leave me?
0 Of course.
2 If it's a movie from the house and I'm gonna watch 'cause my mom didn't, she wouldn't let me see that part.
1 Yeah, no, and it's just that they're always gonna find him on the way, they're always gonna have a chance to see all that.
2 Then I think it's not yes.
0 but what, what if talking about those issues is that censorship or information that is supposed to be censored or
1 Yes
1 That kind of thing to me never looked good because
1 No, I think so.
1 There's a lot of other information about movies that you should go see with your family.
1 Yes
0 and after the film comment on everything that happens and educate them about what is the type of film, the message, the quality with which it was produced etcetera, etc.
1 Yes, that's right.
0 Because the restrictions they put then muc- as you say there is a violence that is eh in a caricature
0 Uh-huh.
0 there is cartoon that are for all children and has an exaggerated violence, no
1 Yeah, and that's not so they're in the middle of the day, the truth.
2 It seems to me that 80 percent of movies are so bad that you don't have to watch them.
1 Yeah, not anymore.
0 No and the other because the best ones are medium and a less than five percent worth seeing.
1 Yes
0 No, but with those you already have enough to have a, an idea of what you need to be looking for, no.
1 Yes
1 If there's enough, it doesn't mean they don't make enough movies, but they do so many that they don't or they have to go see all of them, it's, it's
1 That's right.
0 no and then
1 That's right.
0 if we try for example this to know who they are before going to a movie inform us
0 Uh-huh.
0 about the criticism there is about that movie and then we're coming.
1 Yes
2 It's no, that's what we're always trying to do. We're going to go see this movie.
0 Uh-huh.
2 We've already made a decision, about which movies and since, my kids have had, they've had that education because we really like the movies my wife and I love the movies, so
0 Uh-huh.
0 never even when we were, were smaller
1 Yes
1 If there was any movie sometimes we would lift it even if it was for older than his age, no
0 Uh-huh.
1 And if you could see some scenes, no stronger, but the scene doesn't necessarily make the movie
0 Uh-huh.
0 then we tried to talk about the message, not for example many war movies did not
1 Yes
0 Many war movies are, for example, respecting the soldier-
1 Yeah, good night.
1 Good night. I'm Joe.
1 What's your name?
0 Joe.
0 Joe?
1 Yeah, and what's your name?
1 Alex.
1 Alex, where are you from?
4 Ah, uh, I'm here in L.A. I think we talked about religion earlier.
2 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, I remember, I remember...
1 We talked about October 4th, a long time ago.
2 Uh, what a memory. Yes, yes, I remember, of course.
1 Where are you from again?
1 I'm from Colorado.
1 Oh, yeah. Yeah.
1 Well, what do you think about tonight?
3 Ah. I, I look at television to, through quality not, not classifications.
4 Yeah, me too, I don't pay much attention to the classification, apart from that and I'm in an adult grade it's not clear that I have a girl who
1 I don't want you to watch programs that, uh, will give you nightmares or bad, uh, motivations, but there's a lot of
2 many permissive things also in the for example, the movies outside, because they are every time, I now think it is more violent. I do not know if
1 That's enough to sort it out because they're making pretty violent films out of a lot of songs.
3 No, I, I think I'm interested in the, the movies and, and the television through the subject that, you have.
1 Yeah.
0 Now it is a violent subject and it has no quality it is not a good movie but it does have some violence and, and it is teaching us something
0 Like, a documentary or something about life then it has value,
0 Sure.
0 because one cannot deny the truth of life.
0 Sure.
0 One cannot live life with blind eyes.
2 Like that movie that is, well ally, already came out of the war in Iraq that, I think, is of soldiers that, the experience in which they are passing
2 There's this color actor Jamie named, I think Jamie Foxx.
1 Yeah.
2 And then there's another white boy who looks like, uh, he's traumatized or something when he's in his experience and, in Iraq.
1 And those films can also be political criticism.
1 And yes, right.
1 The Bush administration, perhaps, has always been a war-obsessed administration.
1 Yeah.
1 with Iraq and fool the public.
2 Yeah, transferring a lot of things out of the lie he said to invade Iraq that's really ah, now that you look at it, you really don't, don't.
4 It's not worth it to have done that, more than 2,000 soldiers have already died in all that.
1 E-, it's-, those movies are important because most people are very ignorant of the things that happen in ge-, in life.
0 Because there's no information.
1 Yeah, that's right.
1 The information that we get is all propaganda then it's important to see other versions of what's going on in the world, not just the version of the Bush administration.
5 Yeah, that's right. Well, I, I think the sorting thing today is pretty relative. I know they've had since thirteen, they're clear that the ~Xs are
2 But this one I think the ~R or, these days is well stretched what is allowed or not allowed. Uh, uh, I agree that
2 A lot of movies, aren't they? That don't make sense, for example, there's a lot of gang movies that are gangbangers, a lot of gangbangers are going to see it because like
0 Mhm.
1 You need to see the violence.
1 Those movies are bad.
1 Yeah, they're really bad.
0 Because they teach violence.
1 And it kind of glorifies her in a way.
1 Yeah, and, and they do more than anything not for value, they do it to sell.
1 And that's not to sell to
0 to certain people.
2 Yes, that's why I sometimes see young boys like this replicating the ways they dress or how they walk or how they express themselves or co-, because those are their hero.
1 And that's not right, that's, uh, corrupts youth.
0 the society, the parents, the family has a lot to do with helping the children understand those things and how to send them, right?
6 I'm seeing something if I don't want you to see something, I don't uh, and I mean, I don't try it in a way I said, saying, okay, don't see that.
1 or rather, that I try in an educational way to teach her because this program is not good for her, instead of imposing it by force, in another word.
2 Oh, I, I, too, have a fourteen-year-old son.
0 Mhm.
2 And every time he comes to visit me, I have to put control over the sex channels.
0 Oh, yeah.
3 Yeah, because he's obsessed with it, because when I get out I go to work and look at that.
1 Yeah, it's easy that
4 So I've put control over him, he can't do it anymore because I've got control over him, but I've got control over him because I've put in the initiative to control him.
1 Yeah.
1 So it's the job of every dad and mom to control the TV that the kids are gonna watch and not blame the ratings.
3 Well, in, in my house I have basic cable and I mean, there's no channel that is, that's out of line.
0 Do you have tenagers?
1 I have no, my child is only five years old.
0 Oh, yes, child.
0 So uh, she's got a mean, there's a Disney channel that she loves to watch and we also see the discovery channel she likes, and there's another one.
0 comedy show that aren't so out of place that we both watch next to her that she really likes to laugh, likes the funny thing,
2 But when there are things that are beyond, they go a little further, because I didn't let him see it because I don't want him to learn things that are twisty from there.
1 That makes it entertaining when it's not, it's not, uh, morally correct, or culpable, or socially correct.
0 yes, one, one can teach children but l-, the, the reality is that one as a father should not have his eyes closed, especially when
1 They're going to grow because they're going to have a lot more temptations than we had.
1 Yeah, e-
0 Not because we're not good parents, but because of culture.
0 From culture is more
1 Because the culture today with the Teenagers are ah, gang ah, hip hop music ah a lot of sex, a lot of violence
1 The videos.
0 videos
1 Yeah, all that stuff.
2 And ah it's not easy to control all that one tries and one, I tried to explain what, the consequences yes he gets into this
1 If he does that if he does sex with a girl, these are the consequences that he can get-- what can happen, do you understand me?
1 Yeah.
3 You have to, uh, talk to them all the time because one thing I've seen with parents because I'm a substitute teacher in schools.
1 Yeah.
1 They take good care of their children when they're five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, but when they're growing up and need more help, parents don't know what happens to them.
0 begin to fail and these boys have more temptations and
1 Teenager age is a critical age.
1 And it's at that age of teenager that you should get more into the boy's life.
1 Exactly.
0 not only when he's five or six years old.
3 It's that the way to reason and think, they say, we were teanagers too, I remember how I acted in those years in
1 I had my spirit of rebellion and all that stuff but that's when one needs the guidance of parents the most.
0 So it all depends on the education of the parents, the way they are involved in the lives of the young, not the, not the classifications.
0 classification is only a number.
1 And if you come to see it's like when they're alone with their little friends they can see what they want because there's no one forbidding it.
1 Yeah.
1 Eh, but if you help him by putting it on good ground in, in terms of how good and how bad that helps him a lot to reason before doing
0 take a wrong action.
1 You have to lay foundations for the boys, what is good and what is bad, not only when they are five or six years old but also when they are fifteen, sixteen, eighteen years old
1 Exactly.
1 And it's more important when they're fifteen than when they're five, because when they're five they're gonna follow the easy rules.
1 Yeah.
0 But when they're 14 or 15, it's another story, mate.
1 And they think they're more independent, they don't need dads.
1 Yeah, they've got friends, now, they're already involved in culture.
1 Yeah.
0 Dad or mom have to work, they don't always have the time it's very difficult.
5 Yes, the influence of young people today is very great I agree, although I remember that I also had my, my influence as a friend when, when, when I chamaco and that
2 But I can see that because of the technology and all that stuff because it's even older because really the movies in time when I was a kid weren't as violent as now.
2 There were no video games, the television was much more restricted, there was no teaching of this modern violence, neither blood nor body like the ~C ~S ~I and all those programs that are well pictured, classic
0 to teach things as if they were real.
0 Mhm.
2 Well, it's kind of, uh, young people get used to seeing that as acceptable, but in the time I was growing up, those things were taught and if it had caused chaos.
1 In fact it wouldn't have been allowed at all, but it's true, the mentality is changing and that's why, uh, young people have immense influence.
2 great and negative of these things that are allowed in society. And I then
1 Yeah.
3 I, I hope that when my little girl gets to that time, as a teenager because I'm
0 Come on, it's gonna be a while, buddy.
2 Yeah, I know, time goes fast.
1 Time flies.
2 I remember when I was a baby and now she's jumping and running everywhere and learning a lot of new and curious and questioning things.
0 Hello, my name is Marisa of Philadelphia.
1 Hi, Marisa, it's Carolina, from here, from Los Angeles.
0 Hello, good night.
0 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
1 Today, right, it's three hours before, yes.
1 Oh, I was saying, my mother, how is it going to be?
0 Very difficult, yes.
1 Oh, dear mama, because I'm from Venezuela.
0 Mm.
1 You're from where?
1 I'm Spanish.
0 Oh, okay.
1 Well...
1 And, and, you know, right now we're living a very critical moment, right, with the United States and the, uh, our new president.
1 Yeah.
1 And then ay mamacita darlin'
3 If something like this happens to me, that what I have to say about the United States is not very positive either, because ah mm, I'm not leftist, anyway, then
1 Wow,
0 about, about the United States if that's it, that
1 It's strong, this one.
1 It's very faith-
2 strong, and even, I don't know if you by any chance of life have this, knowledge of a page called uh, TV for all
1 and there you can watch the TV channels of
0 No.
0 all countries of the world including, of course, Spain.
0 Oh, yeah.
3 Uh-huh, it's called that, ~T ~V p-, uh, ~T uh, ~T ~V a four.
1 ~T ~V for all Oh.
1 Uh-huh, a four-four and all ~A~L~L as television for everyone, something like that.
0 Oh.
1 This one, there you can see, well, and we casually uh, we've been watching, uh, a particular channel from Venezuela.
0 Mhm.
1 And, it's a channel, of course of the state but, but really now of the state not as before it was of the state, but as if it wasn't
0 Mhm.
1 And then now we can, uh, really see the truth, what's going on here, what's never been said, and especially with our president who's quite a person.
0 as we say in Venezuela, clear and scratched
0 Mhm.
1 Uh, I don't know if you've ever had a chance to hear it.
5 Well, I think so. Yes, on television and... after the ah mm Ah mm. Summits of the Americas and everything that's going on out there.
2 Exactly, exactly, I mean...
3 Yeah, yeah. They put it here, in, in Philadelphia a ca-, there are several Hispanic channels as usual because Telemundo, Univisión
0 Uh-huh, the same.
0 Galavision and all that.
0 Same here.
1 And you hear everything, yes, and
1 But you know that these people, unfortunately, because they don't mean, they put what's right for them, I...
1 It's not that, and here too, everything is controlled by the government, that is, let's say
1 Exactly, exactly.
0 Uh, just, we hear what they don't-- what they want us to hear.
0 Right, right, and they even put this one, sometimes, they distort.
0 Mhm.
2 They distort what is happening and then I always find myself with people who, for example, call me a shell and what do you think of the crazy one you have as president?
3 Well, the truth is, I totally agree with that crazy guy, ah, well, I'm what you're talking about.
1 I mean, by the time they've said a bit of barbarity, right?
0 Mm.
3 And I woe, my God, I took patience, sir, for it is a subject that is absolvedly delicate.
1 Yeah.
2 Even now, I've had a, several drawbacks here, uh, with even with, with velazolans.
0 Mm.
0 Uh, people who are many years old here and don't know what's really going on in Venezuela.
1 Yeah.
2 And besides that, they're afraid of the idea that they've come to, that communism, that I don't know how much Fidel and that what the other and
2 Well, I don't really know, what, how much knowledge you have, but this, for example, to the situation we're living in Venezuela is a very special situation.
0 Mhm.
2 that it has nothing to do with the Cuban reality, with what happened in this Cuba, as I know, I know them
0 they had to adopt that system, uh, what were the needs that led them to take on that system and, and what happened during the time when
1 This one, they were applying that because obviously there were mistakes as in everything, as we also have mistakes right now.
1 Sure. Yeah.
1 We have been making mistakes, however, because it is working on that basis, as the president says because this, clearly he has a complaint against
0 the government, not against the country but against the government of this world, which they are
0 Sure.
1 They take on policies as they see fit, as they see fit, arbitrarily.
1 Yes, that is to say, it has actually been done, as the question says, the police of the world, they are the ones who make the
1 Exactly.
0 bosses of everything, and, and tell you what's going to happen, and if you don't agree, then to the bad ones, you, you have to agree.
3 That's right, I mean, if you don't, then I'll blackmail you.
0 Mhm, that's right.
0 Uh-huh, so wow, uh...
0 However, with, with everything that is, or the baddest, with violence, woe, with war.
2 Exactly. Exactly, then it's quite a situation.
1 East
5 delicate, but I believe and from what I've seen I feel like the American people somehow wake up, I feel
0 Mm.
0 that there are a little more people who are kind of realizing what's really happening, because they also had them as in a bubble.
1 There's still a long way to go, and that's what gives me the most.
1 Yeah.
1 I get angry because it's so clear that if you know two plus two it's equal to four and you see how they're manipulating people.
0 Sure.
1 the cla-, and one, and them, and you try to tell the other person, see then that it is so, so, so, don't you realize? Then they say no to you, because you are
0 liberal, or communist, that is to say,
0 Sure.
0 Put on some labels and
0 Hey, follow some labels, and bad ones, by the way.
0 Bad, bad, if you're, uh, you're not a terrorist or you're anti-, anti-, get out of here, we don't want you, if you don't like it
0 Right.
2 And I say, but if, uh, no, this country, not bad they're not country, it's the leaders of the country.
1 Exactly, that's what they sometimes tell me, what are you doing here?
1 Yeah,
2 I say, look, I could be in Venezuela and not support the president, that is, the fact that you're in a
0 country or not, so leaving your country doesn't mean you have a position
0 Mhm.
0 No one knows the reasons why people are here.
0 Sure.
0 in, uh, at a given time but that has nothing to do with the opposition because how many people, for example, in Venezuela don't live in Venezuela, and what they're doing is throwing him lavative
0 to the Venezuelan government and the people
0 Mm.
1 I mean, you don't have to be here or there to support or not to support, that is, it's a position very uh, to me, when they tell me that, to me what gives me is laughter
1 Yeah.
1 Well, the same thing that maybe you're doing, thank God, that you're here, you're not in Venezuela.
0 No, but the, also in Spain is the same, what happens that is dis- di-, different, the left-wing government, but even if it was right-wing, that one, another mentality because the
1 people, when you disagree, you throw yourself into the street and, and they make demonstrations and leave that here you never see, I've never seen it.
0 Right, right, no.
0 Oh, Mhm.
1 in a surprisingly high way, that people can't already, uh, no, they don't protest, I say, my God, but what about these people?
2 supposedly to you, when it affects your pocket it's when you react, but it seems like no, I don't know what's going on or, or they change cars and buy a more economic car- I don't know
1 Yeah.
2 I don't know what's going on, but they don't have, I mean, in general, they don't have that kind of need to protest certain things.
1 Yeah.
4 Yet I tell you, I don't know, all of a sudden here. You're in, in Pennsylvania, you told me?
1 Yeah, Philadelphia, yeah.
2 I don't know, but here I've felt like there's a little bit more, like people are starting to wake up.
0 Mm.
1 I feel like they're rejecting the policies of, of, of the current president and, and they're kind of seeing that things aren't really being painted because
5 I too, at first that there was no access to that, to that page I said, "My God, is it true what you are saying about Venezuela?" But I spoke to my friends.
1 And they would tell me, no, girl, what is that?
1 Yeah.
0 very big, well precisely speaking about the subject, the power
0 Power, yes.
1 And television is a power.
2 Yeah, they're the ones who control, I mean, yeah, here.
0 Sure.
0 Uh, Philadelphia is a Democratic city, everybody's a Democrat, but the rest of the state is Republican and people's, so look, the gringa of, of, of people who tell them things
1 I don't know, very, very ra-, very radical.
0 Right.
0 so very religious, very closed, or yes, then
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
0 No, it can, it won't change, so as long as that doesn't change, and then
0 Sure, sure, and what are you doing back in Philadelphia?
2 So I, with my husband here not mm We moved a, a year ago, we used to live in Florida and ah
0 Okay.
0 Here looking for a job, we've, we've just moved and
0 Oh, and you think it's better there than Miami?
2 We're in the process of Mm, well I liked it better, what happens is that it was the, the work issue is better here in the north, in the south it's very saturated.
0 Okay.
1 So, what's going to be done? It's what, the job comes first.
0 Sure, sure, and fi-, and come here and what do you do?
0 He's uh, he's, he works in the pharmaceutical industry, doing, clinical research ah
0 Okay, okay.
1 and I, therefore, look, administrative work, ah, volunteering and
1 Whatever comes out, of course.
1 So what, what I find.
0 But do you already have a lot of time here in the United States?
1 Twelve years, then.
1 Twelve?
0 Mhm.
1 Oh, my mother, I have six here, and we're about to return if God allows us.
2 Yeah, when I got there, there was Bill Clinton, that the country was at, at one, at an incredible stage a lot of work, everybody was happy, the economy was up.
1 Yes, of course.
1 Then the Republicans went into, uh, with Bush and it all went to hell, as he says.
1 Yes, sir, yes, sir, and
2 It's getting bit by bit and this, this one- I don't know, the, the world, Spain is already
1 Yeah.
3 When I go to Spain, everyone goes to, to, to, to my husband, who is American, he looks at it badly and tells me, and he has a lot of resentment, because he says, look at your country this
1 It's tearing the world apart, it's, it's taking over everything and
0 Oh, my God.
0 believe that, yes, they think they are the you know, the owners of everything, and
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
0 and there is resentment of power
3 Yeah, and notice that I used to fall a little bit into that, too, and now I understand it's not like that, it's like us, because we don't have
1 It's our fault, whatever our governments do.
0 Sure.
4 So, before I also saw Americans like this with gringos, because this one, now I understand that they are not, that they are Americans that are united states, because that is another wrong concept that they are handled, right?
0 Uh-huh.
2 Well, we're Americans, too, if the case goes.
0 Sure.
2 and, and then when after I start to think about it a little bit and no, no, no, they're not Americans, not so-, it's government policy, that well, what they do is
1 They decide, they do, then one, of course, reflects it against the people against the country
0 Mhm.
0 But it's not, it's the state's politics of, of the government.
8 Yeah, I don't like it, I'm, I'm Spanish and I'm American, I'm one here the need, and it seems like taste but I do.
0 Sure.
4 and I have to put up with it and I have to put up with what he's doing government, but I don't know, I don't like it, it's a
1 Sure, sure. Yeah, no, and you have, you have your right precisely, because you're in democracy you have the right to protest.
1 Well, but theory, practice, don't say anything, or else
1 Oh, exactly, exactly, not me, I wish this, it, it
1 It's like a regime, yeah.
3 It doesn't affect anything the, uh the project this linguistic but, well, at least it's a very controversial issue, I when I heard
0 Very
2 the subject, I was dying, I said
0 Me.
1 Why?
4 I say, I'm going to talk about Bush, because you saw that I have so much, so much rage that I have to talk about Bush and put him wrong because
2 But, thank God, you're not alone. I hear so many people say, not that it's talk but run away from him and I say
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0 certainly already people are realizing, apart from that
1 Which is,
1 They think people are so gross that they're not gonna give up.
0 Mhm.
0 account of the barbarities they are doing, for God's sake.
2 No, barbarities and then, and, and, I know, everybody gets it, puts their hands on their heads, oh my God, this can't be, I don't know what
1 And no, a, the next week they forgot about it because
0 Right.
0 the press and television, because something else happens that we say stops, to, to distract, something to distract, then people forget.
2 Sure, look. Yeah, and you know it's just a little while ago, here's the end of the American Latin and film festival.
0 Mhm.
2 And by the way, they passed a film, uh this Argentinian, but the directors were Spanish.
0 Mhm.
0 and then, very interesting, because you know that Spanish cinema also has many cinemas, this one of protest, a cinema of
1 Yeah.
0 documentary guy, this one where
0 Mhm.
3 Well, my name is Ibet, who do I like?
1 This is Mercedes.
0 Hey, Mercedes, how are you, where are you from, Mercedes?
0 From Honduras.
0 Oh, from Honduras?
0 Mhm.
2 Wow. I have a concuña that she's from Honduras too.
1 Ah, from where?
2 Uh, I don't know, but I know she's Honduran, too.
0 Oh, that's good.
1 Yes, it is.
1 And where are you from?
1 I'm from Mexico.
1 The city, huh, capital?
3 From the city. Yes, from Mexico City. Yes. And
2 And what do you think about today's topic? What if it's more eh it's easier than ending up with someone young or, or if age makes a difference.
3 Mm, look, well, I already went through that stage and I'm already married, but for example ah mm, because I don't know.
2 I feel like it's hard when you really love the person when you really don't want it I think it's like anything, okay, okay, we're done, okay.
1 Everyone on their side.
0 Uh-huh.
2 So, I think when you really love the person, but in this case, I figure it's because you don't get along with the person.
2 Or because I really don't know, maybe they didn't want to take each other, between the two people, I think there must be more than anything.
0 a communication between
0 Mhm.
1 I mean, between, in the relationship, and if there's not one, one of the two parties is starting to lose out, he's going to see mistrust and he starts.
4 To deteriorate communication, then I think that can cause a break-up but yes, I know that, I feel that it does hurt.
1 And did you ever have a breakup that was hard?
3 Well, uh, really, yeah, yeah, 'cause for instance, before I married my husband, uh, I was hanging out with a person and, for example, uh...
1 Anyway, it wasn't long, but the first, uh, first, my first boyfriend.
1 Yeah?
1 Then this one.
1 It's always hard.
7 I spent a little time with him, it wasn't much the same but it was the first illusion I had, I don't know, and I already this one, I had said, well, and I even said no, for I am going to marry him.
2 Uh, I'm gonna have three kids and I was already putting my castles in the air and when he once came in and said, you know what?
0 How?
0 Mm.
4 I think there was, I had more experience of saying, up to here it ended that I know how to say, uh then I think to him, uhm
1 It wasn't that hard, but for me it was.
0 Mhm.
2 And then now it was all for the good, because then I met, what's right now my husband and wow, and it's so much better.
1 The truth.
1 That's good.
2 Then I don't know.
0 So you've only had two boyfriends.
1 That's right.
2 That's good. lt's better. For what? In trouble, get in trouble.
1 And you?
0 when there's no need.
1 Yeah, and how did it happen to you?
5 Well, I've been there for a while, too, I haven't been there, but I don't think I've ever had any difficult experience.
0 Uh-huh.
1 with a boy who walked, uh, yeah, with the first boyfriend I ever had, that we walked about two years.
0 Uh-huh.
2 Mm, I remember we decided that now, I don't remember why we were just going to cut
0 Uh-huh.
0 But it's this one, ten years ago.
1 Wow.
1 I was nineteen, eighteen was,
1 Are you married right now?
1 Yeah.
0 Oh.
4 And then we, well, we stopped seeing each other. Then, that wasn't so hard because we were apart, I mean, he lived on one side and I on the other.
0 Uh-huh.
3 Then, with another boy with whom I walked, we also walked a few months also he did not live where I, where
0 Uh-huh.
1 We were at the university where we were and he went back to his country of origin.
0 Uh-huh.
1 And of that it was also easy because you stop seeing it and fast-, that is, it is easy, for truth
1 Yeah.
1 That way.
1 Yeah.
6 What else? Let's see what else. After that I didn't have any other formal boyfriend until S-, more what, yes, the truth than the experiences I never had any man-, experience like I don't know, right? Thank God.
4 No, yeah, it's just that sometimes, I don't know, well, for example, I think that in, in my case, uh, with the first person I think I got too attached
1 Well, it was a hell of a lot.
0 Mhm.
2 And it wasn't long, I think it was like two or three months.
0 Mhm.
2 But, maybe I was flying because they said, ah, this is my first boyfriend and I'm probably gonna marry him and stuff like that,
1 Yeah.
3 And in-and he, and he didn't think so, he said good she, I don't know if it was his third, fourth, fifth, I don't know
7 but I said yes, because I am not going to marry her, I am going to walk with her and I am going to meet her and even there. Instead, because I believe, I was the one who had the illusions for that.
1 And this one, yes, it does hurt, really.
0 Right.
1 Uh, yeah, it hurts because I think you're excited and you have a lot of faith in that relationship and when a person comes in and says no, so now.
1 But I think it must have hurt a lot more when you already live with the person as a marriage.
1 Yeah.
5 I think it has to be the worst experience, I think, of your life is, yes, and I hope, I hope I never pass it because we don't know, right?
0 Mhm.
3 Then I hope never to pass, until now, I have three years married and everything is working because not wonderful, but everything is fine.
1 Thank God.
1 A lot of communication and stuff.
1 You say it's nothing either, because everything can be perfect, it's true, always, and besides.
1 Yeah.
0 Because there are people who are wrong there are people who think that, oh, that marriage is the, uh, it's according to the epoque of ah, and all quietness
0 No.
0 But one lives with the people day and night and looks at it the ge-, i.e.
1 Yeah.
1 It is impossible, then, for a truth to be maintained?
0 No, yeah.
2 Yeah, you always love the person, but it's impossible that it's just peace, because that's what I'm saying, right?
1 Yeah.
2 Because one, because I, I am one, is a human being and one has to, things that really bother other people, right?
1 Yeah.
2 see-, to any other people, for I am not telling the person that one is particularly, but anyone else, for I know that
0 eventually, for as we have a saying, no, it is not a coin of the whole world, all day long, the twenty-four prays of the day, for all the rest of life, for
1 That's right.
1 Yeah.
3 Yeah, actually I'm- - I think it's gotta be something the truth, uh, really hard to, uh, keep everything cheerful, right?
0 Mhm.
3 And I think that too and I think that, uh, when you're wearing your courtship, for example, you can know and, as you're meeting the person
2 that, of course, you're not going to know her thoroughly, are you? until you're already married to that person but this one but I think I think that
2 If you see that you don't really take that person with you and for example, I've met people, uh, who beat their boyfriends as boyfriends, beat them, and mistreated them and forced them to everything they wanted then.
1 I think those relationships are never gonna come to anything good, because if they're not married yet
1 And to try
2 And they're already being treated like that. Imagine what it's gonna be like if they're gonna be married, no, but they're gonna say you're my owner.
2 Yeah. Yeah.
3 I think that a, that those relationships, uh, I don't think they're ever gonna work, I don't know.
2 or change or end a relationship like that, I think if it were a relationship like that, because I think it won't hurt anything, unlike
1 You have to rest if you have a boyfriend who beats you or that.
0 Mhm.
3 You're going to rest, you're going to say, oh, good thing we're done, and I don't know, and I think if, for example, everything starts to get along and everything
3 It's all wonderful and suddenly someone, I don't know, has to go to another country for example or has to go to another school, I think it would hurt a bit there too.
1 Yeah.
1 Because, everything is fine, but only for the third circumstances, because they have to be separated. So, I think that in that type of relationship, it does hurt, but if it is a relationship so
0 they hit you and stuff like that, so don't
0 Oh, no, yeah, that. Pe-, and what, what is uh, ironic is that uh, those are usually, there are times that those are relationships that are more difficult.
0 for that, for the people who are in-, involved in that kind of relationship
1 That's right.
0 Because usually, well, uh, people know, when they're in that kind of situation is, there's like a self-confidence is pretty low.
0 Uh-huh.
3 And then they think that, you know, people think that this is what, it's the best thing I'm ever gonna be able to, uh, what I'm gonna be able to achieve.
2 I have to hold on, I have to keep holding on,
1 Yeah.
2 And then uh, it's really not as easy as you think that ah, you already did this to me, I'm gonna send you through the tube, no.
1 That's right.
1 It's hard, rather, because uh, it gets like no, it's like, not to say addicted, but if to the, to that kind of situation that
2 The drama is al-, it's, uh, pretty much, right? And then people don't know how to get out of that cycle of, of abuse, right?, that's what happens.
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, you're right because
1 Yes, but
1 For example I once in, being in Mexico, met a girl who, uh, once came in with black glasses to her tra-, to work.
0 Mhm.
7 And I said to him, "What now are you wearing glasses?" So it was cloudy in the day, wasn't it?" And she had a blow that her boyfriend had hit her.
1 Ah.
6 And he said, dabes, I told him, I think you shouldn't be per-, I don't know, I told him, but, I think you shouldn't let him touch you.
1 your boyfriend because and she said, well it's just that I'm ma-, it's really hard for me to end my relationship with him.
2 In spite of everything I want.
0 Mhm.
2 And then, wow, I gave him-- what? How can it be possible that you want a person who beats you, who beats you? Sometimes she came, uh, bruised, or sometimes this one.
1 Ah.
0 He was slapped or something like that.
0 Oh, no.
2 And when she finally managed to make it, I remember that she was the one crying and crying and crying every day.
4 every time I could cry on breaks and things like that because I missed him and all that. So, I think I do, in a way sometimes this
3 Some relationships, I think. Well, I guess it was very painful for her.
0 Carolina.
0 Fabiola
0 How are you, Fabiola?
1 Good. And you?
1 Okay, okay. Where are you going?
2 In Washington?
0 Oh, my God.
1 And you?
2 I'm in L.A.
0 Ugh.
1 Yes
0 Let's get out of here.
3 We're extremes. That's good. And where are you from?
0 Chilean.
0 From where.
1 Hey, chillán chilean.
1 Okay, I'm from Venezuela.
0 From Maracaigo?
1 No, you don't. Why, do you know people there?
2 Yes, I know some people from Maracaigo.
1 Well, you know they have a stronger accent.
0 Uh, yeah, yeah.
1 Aha.
1 Look at you. Are you arepa?
3 A-yes, yes. And that's good, that's good. Because, sometimes it's so hard to find Venezuelans, and, and they say, no, no, we really know few Venezuelans, this and that, and I, oh, my God.
2 We're a few around here really, but, like, within a, mm, about, mm, maybe about ten years, I think they've, mm, increased.
1 Yeah.
0 Mhm.
1 I know- yes, nail girl from Venezuela, and, in Houston.
1 Mhm Oh. You work at the Hilton?
0 No, no, no, no, no.
0 Oh, my God.
2 Texas. No, no, no, I work in the house.
0 Okay, okay, perfect.
1 You work?
2 Yeah, I work with deaf kids.
0 Oh.
2 Aha, well o- Right now, actually, I'm working with the parents of deaf kids.
1 That's a good job.
0 Hey, yeah, pretty strong.
1 Yeah, but, uh, it makes you happy to have...
1 Yeah.
0 to be able to help people.
5 Exactly. And, I-I did the same thing in Venezuela, only, uh, I did it with sign language.
2 There I learned the alphabet in, in, ah
0 Oh, okay, okay, Chilean, of course, right?
1 I'm learning it-- yeah, yeah.
0 Mhm.
0 But by sign.
0 Mhm, that's right, but it's oral here.
1 Oh, here I was taught by my daughter the alphab-the alphab-uh, a few words.
0 Okay.
1 Not all, some like I love you and stuff.
0 Mhm.
1 Yeah, you little palabrites.
0 Mm, okay.
0 But, cute.
2 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now I'm-it's in the oral part.
0 Because this is a, here is an incentive for children to talk.
1 What do you mean, talk?
0 Mhm.
1 Without listening, but, talk, make them...
1 Yeah, no, yeah, 'cause they, uh, with hearing aids, they can get to hear.
1 Ah.
1 So, I-what you do is, you're trained to listen so that they recognize the sounds.
1 That's nice.
1 Mhm, mhm, yes, yes, that's like one, a possibility that they have, then, of being able to speak plainly. They're never going to speak perfect, the, you, you're going to feel the difference talking.
0 But, you're definitely going to have that option, so, that even in, uh, there's-- there's some parents that combine, the sign language with the oral part.
1 the degree of hearing loss of, of, of the child. If it is too deep, where there are no possibilities but not with the best operation, then, there,
0 Uh, sign language is used as a complement.
1 What a hard job for parents.
3 Mhm. It's a job, really. It's good, well hard. But, it's good, uh, rewarding. Well, in the end, uh, and it has its, its, its prize, well. Of course, it has to really get, as we say, to get it up.
0 Because, otherwise, mm, well, it's hard, then, l- it's gonna make it, then.
1 And what do you think of, of the subject we were given today by the-?
3 Well, look at you, it's a candela theme. Candela, candela, really. I think that couple relationships are nothing simple. You have to deal with a person who,
0 that is different from you, that comes from another world, another culture, another way of being, and, then, try to have a single project, like,
1 But, I think love is the only thing that makes the barriers can be overcome, but nothing.
0 Only if there is, if there is love and if there is a lot of willingness of the, of the couple for those, those differences and those, mm, those, uh, encounters that you can have at a given time,
1 What do you think?
4 Yes, of course, I think I think I'm going to do more than love and all that, because love is the same.
0 Mhm.
0 is acquired over time.
0 Sure.
1 So, I think you want to support a family, you have to want to support a family because there are a lot of people who love.
0 Mhm.
1 And, they're so young, that the first thing they think about doing when they get the chance, fight, break up.
0 Right.
2 They don't work hard. And, they love each other, and they love each other perhaps more than a couple who have been married for thirty years.
0 Sure.
0 But, they fight day by day and pass the troubles, go over the problems.
0 Right.
2 And, that's what I think you need mm, today's people, to have patience and n-
1 Yeah.
0 to think that if you decided to stay with that couple, or marry that couple,
0 Sure.
1 Even if there are problems, don't run away to the first problem you encountered.
1 Well, look at me with mm, my husband, we've got, we're gonna be eight years married,
2 And, I'm twelve.
2 And, and, and, and we've really had, well, two critical moments, critical, about to split up. And, and, and, there came a point where maturity, there, plays an important role. Right?
1 Yeah.
1 I, another time in my life, would have left.
0 Me too.
1 Aha.
1 It would have mattered nothing, but,
1 I wouldn't care about anything, nothing, but, look, not a damn thing.
5 Ah, so I say, if I fall, I stop again. What's the problem?
1 Exactly.
1 But now I think about it three times.
5 So, now I really think about it and say, no, but he has other things. This, me, I focus on the good things he has, I say, he's different from me, he can't think like me, and I don't have to bother if he doesn't think like me.
1 But, neither does that-- I want to let it get to me.
1 Oh, sure, I do the same thing.
4 I mean, exactly. So, fortunately, well, uh, the first time was really horrible, because I thought it was the end of the world. And, well, there we were, and we lasted a good time that we didn't treat until one good day, I said, well, but, what's going on?
3 We have, we had almost three weeks. We had never spent three weeks without seeing, without talking to each other. And, sleeping in the same bed.
0 Oh. my god.
2 I said, look, you know what, yeah, I think,
2 It didn't touch me. I didn't get to that.
1 I said, you know what, it seems to me that this is a log of spoils.
5 We don't have, I mean, this doesn't make sense. If you want to continue the project, we continue it. If you don't want to continue, we don't continue it. I love you.
4 I love you, but we can't go on like this, because you're going one way and I'm going the other way, and really believe me that I love you, and because I love you,
1 I need us to define this, because it's foolish of us to live like this. Besides, a place like this, God doesn't bless it.
0 Because, no matter how serious the situation may be, that a- fortunately it wasn't a serious thing but uh, like neither of us wanted to give the arm to twist.
1 It was pride.
0 Foolish pride. 'Cause, that's it.
1 It sure ain't good for nothing.
0 Not at all, quite the opposite.
0 affects only.
3 Exactly. So, well, fortunately, we took the course again. And then, we had another one, and yet this one was smaller. I think the first one was really the one that marked us.
4 And, it went well, well, in fact, I was about, as we say here, about candy. I said, nothing, so far I got.
0 Candy is like ready to throw in the towel.
5 I said, nothing, no, no, no, I'm not gonna co-exist you, I'm telling you. I don't let you, I mean, you're wrong.
2 If I have learned something in this life, it is to seek solutions for the things that can be.
0 Sure.
2 For- what are we going to do with a mediocre relationship? I don’t want a mediocre relationship. As you yourself say, there are people who spend up to thirty years together, and that’s a dirty relationship.
1 Yeah?
2 This, look, piece of I don't know what, what, what is that?
0 No, it's-- it's a girl, and sometimes they treat each other well, but they don't love each other.
1 Exactly, too.
1 They're, they spend their whole lives together.
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, look, there's a thousand things going on, really, there's so many things going on in couples that it's, it's a very interesting topic, because, you say,
2 There are really people, who look, they take it super from the best, but they don't want it. Like, well, I got used to living with it.
1 They just respect each other, and,
1 Exactly.
1 And, what they wanted to form was the family, and that's it.
1 There are others who definitely do what they want and b-, and they keep an image.
2 And, there are others who say, love. If there is no love, there is nothing.
5 There's nothing, there's nothing. There really has to be a great, great love. That's why I tell you, because I feel that in my relationship, what could have been love.
0 Because really, with a situation so, so difficult, like the one we live in, if there hadn't been love, there wouldn't have been, no, it would have been, that simple. Because, it just didn't make sense.
3 There was no point in continuing something that, uh, where there was no love. So, I feel like yes. A lot of love, and a lot of that commitment that you're talking about, of really wanting,
0 be there because you want to, because it's worth it.
1 Because, of course, because no one forces you. You want to be there, and, and you fight.
1 Exactly, exactly.
1 You can have a couple, it's hard.
1 Exactly.
1 The hardest thing, then, is to keep it.
2 Cla- that's the hardest thing. Yes, sir. And, look, how to be constantly in that, uh, uh, in that harmony that, like new things, we're going to do this differently, we're going to, we're not going to fall into that routine.
0 Hey,
0 But no, it's just that the time comes when you know, but the important thing is that you can get out of it.
1 That's right, of course.
1 And that the system still leads you to that.
0 Sure, your husband's Chilean, too?
0 No, he's from here.
1 Like, uh, it's a little bit more. I mean, it's not that it's more difficult.
1 So easy, I say.
1 You think it's easier?
0 Pa-and, uh, well, for certain things, easier.
0 Oh, okay, okay. 'Cause, my husband is Venezuelan, and,
0 For certain.
4 And sometimes, I say, I think, that that has nothing to do with the, with nationality. I think those are universal things.
4 Yeah, I think it's easier for me because sometimes, the, they're well entertained because I don't understand what he says or he says he's touched, so it doesn't go well, no t-no, I didn't have a point to fight.
1 A lot with him, 'cause it makes me laugh.
0 So, what did you tell me?
0 Or when we're super b-
0 Bad.
0 Hey.
0 Hey.
0 Halo.
0 Hello, hello, how are you?
3 Well, I'm Viola from Idaho.
3 I'm Alicia from Atlanta.
1 Atlanta.
1 Yeah.
0 Oh, how are you?
1 Well, what about you?
0 Good, good.
1 That's good, and where originally
0 From Chile.
0 Me too.
0 Really?
1 Yeah.
0 Oh, that's good.
1 That's fun.
1 And how long have you lived here?
3 Yeah, well, I'm sort of in the for example, I'm there all two thousand three.
0 Oh, okay.
2 And what's his name, and of course then he came and came back but about ninety-one, yeah. And you?
1 I've been living here since two thousand two.
0 Oh, it's not that much, for nothing, for nothing.
0 Not so long ago, recently.
1 And of Santiago surely
1 Yes, from Santiago.
0 Sure.
1 And you, where are you from?
1 Hey, I lived.
0 From Santiago, too?
0 Of course, there in Santiago lived the and in Concepción.
0 Oh, okay.
0 Sure.
1 Look at that. What a world.
1 Yeah, that sounds good.
1 And you've been on this thing for a long time, calling?
2 Because no, I don't know what, I wrote Monday to do
0 Oh, yeah?
2 And I didn't know anything up there,
0 Did he?
1 I mean, yeah.
1 Ah, okay.
1 Oh, I wish it wasn't a bad phone, but sometimes.
0 Oh, okay.
1 No, but he said what he's been, taking calls as far as I know.
1 Ah, are you already ah, are you calling every day?
4 Well, I started clear once, and I was called four times, but I could only answer one.
0 Oh. Okay.
1 Yeah.
3 Yeah. Yeah, they called me this week, too, but I can't answer that.
1 Well, uh...
0 week so it was like half lazy.
1 Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1 Yeah,
1 I'm telling you, it's been
1 Yeah.
0 fun that give a theme will be for
2 To talk, to have to talk I think.
0 no ah, yes that must be
2 Yeah, I think so.
3 I thought I thought it was like this this studio to do a what I know call phone menus and stuff like that.
0 Hey.
0 For hospitals and theaters and things like that and then they wanted people to talk about things about health and things like that.
2 Not what happens is that I was told that they were giving issues because just like I suppose you don't have to talk about personal things.
0 Oh, why shouldn't union or because you don't want to?
0 Because you shouldn't be like very personal things.
1 Ah,
0 Because you never know the other person on the phone, because
0 Oh, right, oh, right.
0 So that's why they give topics to have to talk about.
2 Oh, yeah, I thought because it was part of the studio that wanted to hear words in Spanish or Spanish how I know.
0 Oh, okay.
0 No, but no.
1 Yes, the only thing they told me was that we had to talk about topics as with no importance, but
0 Sure with.
0 to have as a subject, not to speak like pure heads of sin.
0 Sure, it's the fruit.
2 Well, yes, I do.
1 Yeah.
1 Yeah, and you like it here?
2 It's not that good Idaho right.
0 Hey.
5 Yes, I was in Washington about seattle when I first arrived in America, of course.
0 Hey,
7 And that, now I'm in Georgia, I'm south, then I'm in good as where everyone is very here and and what do I know about the band and I'm in Atlanta and
1 ♪ And more is put here ♪
0 Hey.
1 Uh, but Idaho already, for example, the state is well rural, not like that.
0 yes it is like a field and all well country,
2 Yeah, I imagine just as it doesn't depend.
3 Yeah, it's like half is half is like I don't know it's like night life, I don't know,
2 Oh, the thing is, I'm in Atlanta and it's a pretty big city.
1 Two three years.
0 Hey.
2 Uh, well, something and one that every business and every bar every club has to close at 2:00 in the morning. Look at you.
0 Hey, two o'clock.
0 at two in the morning, all closed.
0 Oh, and why?
2 Well, the reason is that there's the sector as well as the thing and thing in Atlanta is called Bucks Head.
0 Hey.
1 And like, and already about two, three years ago there was their crimes and thing, and three people were killed.
0 Oh.
1 Out there, then the city over again mayor what do I know, then yes since good people are killing
0 Oh.
0 But it's the same, but it's the way it is, a city like that has to be oblation.
1 Yeah, well, like, are people there using car arto, or is there more as a collective?
0 Oh, it's not much of a car, it's too much of a car, yeah.
3 We, uh just like that because going out at 2:00 in the morning isn't so
1 Well, it's just...
0 if you have a car or something.
2 of course. It is not that the bad thing is that for example I would prefer a thousand times to have such a good system for simple reason of the problem of
0 face and in addition that
1 Yeah.
1 A lot of congestion.
0 Oh, okay.
0 So, of course it's like horrible traffic, that's delay like anywhere.
1 Yeah.
1 Yeah, the car.
1 It's totally different here.
0 Oh, yeah, like over there.
1 Well, there's arto auto, people have cars all over the world because it's a necessity, something like that.
0 Sure.
0 because there is no collective.
1 Ah.
1 they are as if it does not take so long, as to go to so many parts the, where the city where I live is like half of the port Santiago but there are many fewer people, because
0 So.
0 Because you knew things here are how the houses are bigger, they're more separate, things like that.
0 Sure, it's on or off.
3 And I'm not in Idaho Falls.
0 Oh, that's it.
1 Idaho Falls
1 Yeah,
2 In, I go to a bigger city then.
0 Mm.
1 There in a bigger city but
0 Sure.
0 Not where we are, it's field.
0 Oh, that's good, it's just as clear.
1 Ah.
1 We were Latinos.
0 Not here is arto as there are machines that do.
0 Oh, that's it.
1 There is arto Mexicano and since it is mostly a rural place
0 Mm.
0 hire Mexican artos as well as to do work in
1 Ah.
0 the land and stuff.
0 Oh, sure as.
1 So almost always what you see are Mexicans. It even looks and people also confuse you by Mexicano.
0 Sure, yeah, yeah.
0 less latina, they say ay Mexicano.
0 Sure, wheat.
1 Then you have to go around saying, no, no, no.
0 No.
1 I'm not Mexican.
3 That's what I like arto think I'm like Palestine or a water thing, yeah.
1 Yeah.
3 Yes, I eat food from the Middle East and they tell me
0 Hey.
5 And they try to speak to me in Arabic, I don't know. They find me more face of India or something but claor, and is there discrimination there or not?
1 Uh uh. Yeah, same, same, but no.
0 Oh, but
1 I mean, yeah, like everywhere.
0 Oh, right.
1 Anyway, it's mostly like it's with people who are Latino but don't know much about it but
0 Oh, right.
0 Because there's still people just like they're going to buy and they don't know anything about
1 And of course, of course.
1 And then they have to walk, but people, you know, like everywhere, are the means.
1 Yeah, yeah, sure.
0 Because they're very discriminatory there, you know what?
2 Well here's like super nowadays that Atlanta and the whole south is like sixty percent black as well.
0 Oh, okay.
1 So it's like, the fact since it's more diverse that's how much more uh, acceptable what I know but at the same time south is the south of the
2 America has that story of being one of the most racist places in all of America, actually here.
0 Oh,
1 There was slavery and all that, then, just like there was a certain minority of white people who hate any ethnic group and have their weird demonstrations and all that stuff, but
0 Oh, but things like that are strong, yeah.
0 Sure.
1 They fight hard.
1 Yeah, but.
0 Not here, it's not like such a massive thing is not like some kind of heavy thing but not like groups things like that.
1 clear for example in the rural parts of Georgia you would see things as you see the Ku Klux Klan I don't know
0 Oh, yeah, really.
1 Yeah, still.
0 Oh, mm.
1 And that those weird things but it's very far away what the city is.
0 Hey.
3 You're inside the city of Atlanta. You're in place to say more civilized then those things don't.
0 Hey.
1 Yeah luckily, look what happened, then.
0 Oh, that's weird.
1 And how did you get to iadho like this?
1 Oh I married a gringo.
1 Oh, sure, a Idaho.
2 I married a gringo, that's how I got here.
1 Well, my mom married a gringo.
0 Oh yeah?
3 Yeah, so that's why we came to Seattle in '90s, I was eleven like that.
0 Mm.
2 And but my dad stayed in Chile and that's why, I go back and forth like this.
0 Oh. Okay.
0 Sure.
0 Mm. Okay.
1 And a
0 Okay.
1 Interesting.
0 So you're single now?
1 One like that, I'm kind of living together.
0 Oh, okay.
1 Then of course.
2 Okay Ah, look. And what's the name of this you like or don't like?
7 Yeah, because I mean I'm inside the city, I like it's more city maybe, I'm from city or country. For example I lived in San Rafael I don't know if you're located but
1 way from San Felipe to the Andes which is like a more rural question and you didn't imagine how
0 Oh.
1 typical Chilean country and I loved that.
1 Yeah.
4 Like a village, I don't know about it. Or I like being inside the city that I know how to be cool, I don't know, there are more things to do.
2 But I don't know why, but what I'm burdened with is
1 Ah.
1 Then
0 Oh. Okay.
1 Yeah.
1 It's not like
0 But.
0 So it's not a super drastic change for me to come here.
2 Yeah, I guess so.
3 Because as I was used to living in the city, no, and here, but there's still a city nearby I could find everything I need but life is more
0 She's calm as it is.
0 Sure.
0 calmer and all, maybe it's not good because it's for example the uh, there's not as much crime as in a bigger city.
0 Sure.
0 But it's kind of boring.
2 Yeah, I guess so.
0 Medium
0 Still in touch, it's hard too.
0 Here. yes, but not so much. not so much. that as even at least small is not so big.
0 Oh, hello, Juan, Marcela.
0 Hi. How are you? My name is Juan. Marcela.
1 Yeah. How's it going?
0 Hey, we didn't talk the other day with
2 You're on tiles and I'm in North Carolina.
2 Yes, I'm very pleased.
1 That's it, nice to meet you.
4 I didn't forget you. We practiced together, didn't we? Yeah. Hey, but I'm playing, cheers.
1 Yeah.
0 Do you have social security here?
1 Hey, I'm covered through my husband.
0 Uh uh.
1 And the kids are covered, so we're fine.
1 Ah, well, notice that we do, we don't.
1 It's a problem, isn't it?
1 It's a problem because something can always happen, right?
1 We're very healthy but you never know.
2 And the other day I went precisely to an office where they supposedly gave a kind of pension for
0 people like that in the community, right?
1 Yeah.
2 And so the papers they asked me for with my homicile and work vouchers. And, finally, they found the pretext for not, not to give it to me because they asked me to
0 to give information about the person who was hiring me and at that time because the person did not want to give the information, right?
0 Mm.
2 And, in my case, I have a son who has epilepsy.
1 Ah.
1 And, then he needed some emergency tension here things that
1 And they didn't give you, uh, the attention?
0 No, no, they didn't want to describe me.
2 And then I had to go back to Mexico and have him taken care of by the doctor who sees him.
0 Mm.
2 And they prescribed it and then I ran out of medicine here once.
1 Yeah, but it might be cheaper.
1 It's a problem with the prescription and then a friend who's a doctor had the samples and gave me samples of medicine.
2 Yeah, that helps. What a thing.
0 No? yes, he gave me. So yes, it is something that we think that there should be some kind of little more flexible, no, for there is in itself for the community but it is a certain kind of community.
0 No, it seems to me that the whole system is going to have to fall before they do something different, because it seems to me that it is already very difficult to fix it because there is
1 the costs of, the costs of everything, depends on the demand. And then if those costs go up, up and up
2 Yeah. Yeah.
2 And then the costs go up because people ask for more money and the people who work ask for more money, it's a vicious circle. And then how can they suddenly do a social medicine?
1 Yeah.
1 It's impossible because all those people are already like
1 Yeah, it should be.
0 Money doesn't stop being like a drug, you see, they're used to a certain amount of money.
0 Uh uh.
1 And then now, suddenly they won't have it.
1 Exactly. lt's a problem, it's a circle that works with profit here is stronger, isn't it?
2 Yes, of course I do.
1 Then the interest is uglier.
1 We'd stop making bombs and going to war.
0 Mm.
0 in schools or in a system of medicine, social medicine.
1 Mm. Mm. Well, a little bit more than getting him down.
1 Mm. Yeah.
1 Because I don't know where you're living here, but if anyone has money, it's the nurses and the doctors.
1 Yeah, well, nurses pay them pretty well because few nurses know there's less.
0 So, um, and then here, like they say, once a good car with a woman who's there for thirty years, for example, right?
0 Mm.
1 And she's a nurse and that's how they happen when you really find out if they're nurses.
1 Tell me, twenty, thirty dollars an hour.
3 Yeah, yeah me Uh uh. So who in this case is it like it does offer. In Canada I understand well they have a lot of medicine, right?
0 Mm.
0 So any resident in Canada has a right to medical services, because they're there, and they have no major impact on the economy really.
0 No, but the difference is they started right.
1 And that's Mm.
2 Yeah, it's like in Argentina, my parents have, uh, all the medicine pays.
0 Uh uh.
2 All the medicine pays. They pay a little, no, but it's very little.
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the other thing one could at least try to pay for something.
1 Yeah.
0 He's gonna have some kind of insurance, but that's it.
1 It's, it's expensive.
3 And then I don't know how I know the medicines here, well, in Mexico they're cheaper and it's more like that.
0 everywhere in the world, everywhere in the world.
1 And there's more drug competition there than for the thing.
2 Yes, there was a medicine I was taking, my son took for a short time and it turns out that there was no medicine here, you saw, without the mark.
0 Uh uh.
3 Uh, and then this one, we went to Argentina last year, I went to the pharmacist and I showed it to him and something that cost over fifty dollars here.
1 I bought it over there for $12.
3 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1 Twelve dollars, the same brand and everything.
1 Yeah.
2 And it could have been less if I bought another brand, the unknown brand one thing.
1 Same. Yeah.
1 But I don't understand.
1 And the case of Mexico, for example, my son's medicine is in five, six marks.
0 Mm.
0 with similar ingredients.
0 Mm.
3 And here there's just one, and second that in literature it's not the best, and it's hear but only the labs, I thought all the North American labs would just, uh...
0 So when it comes to competition, there's a monopoly here.
3 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1 We were very interested in everything, weren't we?
1 Of course I do.
0 Mm.
1 So what do I know, according to what if
0 But.
1 You know what you'd have to do?
1 Yeah.
1 Why don't you get in touch with an organization called the Shriners?
0 Uh uh. uh, yeah.
0 Shriners do.
4 Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know.
0 Hey, 'cause they help kids.
0 Mm.
1 Now I don't know if they specialize in a specific illness or if they cover everything because maybe
0 Mm.
1 You can communicate with them and tell them, hey we have this child and this is his condition and this is our situation.
1 Yeah.
1 And maybe they can help in some way because the Shriners are dedicated to helping, to paying for the medical care of children they can't afford.
0 Uh uh, uh, well, yeah, look, yeah.
0 parents can't afford it.
0 Hey, what's the time or what?
2 What do I know, they say it's twelve minutes, but their twelve minutes look like half an hour.
3 Ah. Notice that.. yes I knew only him and thought it was for me.. and I smaller without tires and so on..
2 Yeah, maybe I'm wrong, but not finding out, you see, it doesn't cost anything.
1 I'm going to crash.
1 And also if you call Catholic Charities
0 Uh, uh, that's right.
1 Maybe they, maybe they have what I know, a vibe or something you saw that can help you in a
1 Yes, it is very simple because actually, well on the one hand maintenance is a medicine that this person who helped me with the sample says no man these
0 Here they give us, you have no problem. Just see some community center or something and
0 Mm.
3 There's a lot of evidence. And, but knowing a little bit more about the advances. is that I can give medicine we thought that a deeper diagnosis could improve my son's life with
0 with epilepsy, right?
0 Sure.
0 Because he was under control but lately he's been out of control for about two years now.
1 And of course he's growing up and then maybe that medicine won't do him any good, they have to give him another one.
3 And, well it gives me, it gives me yes. Yes, it was given another. They potentiated it and it fell badly and then no way, it had to be removed and returned to the basics.
0 Mm.
1 Yes, it did get worse.
1 What a thing.
1 Yeah, yeah, well, you know, it's just a matter of experimenting.
1 And you, you must live with your heart in your mouth.
2 Well, yes, sometimes I do.
1 And that's a lot of stress.
1 Always do.
1 A lot of stress.
1 Even if you don't say it, you're always on the lookout, all the time.
2 Mm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
3 Then you know that you're always hoping it won't happen. Well, I don't know what's really going to happen.
0 Mm.
1 It happens at school and then it feels really bad.
0 Of course because he's ashamed of himself.
1 Yeah, yeah, it's a stigma, it's a stigma, what it has, right?
0 How old is he?
1 Ten and seven.
0 Oh, of course she's a teenager.
4 In itself, I'm good at getting back to the subject. I think I should be good guys here.
2 Yeah. You know where you can find out, too, in the hospitals they teach.
0 system of eh
1 To doctors, to medical centers where there are medical schools.
0 Uh uh.
1 There many times the different departments
1 Yeah.
1 They see people who don't, they can't pay in the situation as normal, you see, like us who can't go to a specialist doctor because it costs a lot of money.
0 Mm.
1 And we don't.
1 Mm. Yeah.
3 And then they take from them. And then they take note of what they give to you. And they charge you accordingly.
0 Something that you guys can be good at, uh, doing, sometimes you don't get paid anything.
0 Mm.
4 In the month, and that's this interesting one. I had to make an abscess. I happen to have one thing called ADD.
0 Uh uh.
6 And I thought years ago I had it but in the end I went and I had diagnosed myself and in the end I found here in the hospital teaching at the University of North Carolina
0 Uh uh.
1 And they didn't charge me anything and they took all the tests.
0 Oh, yeah?
1 Yeah.
1 So it's all very well, which orientation we're going to go to, because in fact, where I just went it's called University System, healthcare system something like that but
0 Oh, yeah, so there's that with the
0 So that's where they bounced me.
1 With college. Huh?
1 I told him.
0 Oh, what a thing.
1 Mm. Uh uh. So, they did tell me no because you have to bring us information. I was carrying a letter of my income, et cetera, no?
0 Mm.
0 But, no, we need your employer's social security, and that's where they didn't want to.
1 They didn't want to give you that information.
2 Well, now I have my social security, myself.
0 Oh, so maybe you can.
2 Yes. Employee.
0 Mm.
2 Well, I'm coming anyway.
0 Maybe you can now.
0 Uh uh.
0 Hi, how are you?
0 Hello, good. Hey, Mateo here.
3 I'm in San Antonio. Mateo, I think we've already talked, you're in Philadelphia.
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, and you're
2 Ah, look, I'm glad to talk to you again.
1 Yeah, how, how have you been?
0 Hey, all right, this one, what do you think of today's subject?
1 No, I didn't hear it, what's the point?
0 the subject are the technical apparatuses, that is the technology, the apparatuses that you use most and that you depend so much on them and if, how do you consider that dependence
1 And how do you consider the question of technology, right, your daily life, if it becomes more of a problem than a solution or something like that?
0 Does that include, automobile, cars?
2 It's the same thing that, it's the same thing that I was thinking, of course, you should include it, right?
1 Yeah, because it's a, you know, a machine.
3 Exactly, then, but, I said good then yes, the car seems to be the most important thing, right?, it's- then I thought maybe it's the computer, but it's not.
1 Yeah, the most obvious is the computer, but it's not the only one.
0 Uh-huh, exactly, but sometimes, uh, what seems like a more personal element depending on the case, because it can be the car, right? Because the computer is already a tool more and more
1 For more than, of, sometimes, let's say, the one that belongs to the institution where you're staying, isn't it? It's more of a working tool.
0 ah
0 But a very personal tool like that seems to be the car, doesn't it?
1 Yeah, and that's why, the same thing you buy a car and you're always using it and you always have to keep it, you always have it, somewhere in your life.
0 Because, you have to take care of the car and, you know?
3 Yeah, exactly, plus how I'm here in Texas.
0 ah
1 I feel that here the culture of the car is as well a reminiscence of the culture of horses as well.
1 You guys used horses more?
1 It's like a horse, it's kind of very, very, very personal, very close.
1 Yes
1 A, to one's life, here they take care of them and it's as important as, come on, like the horse at that time, right?
1 Yes
0 a few years ago and, and well, they do not say, because in our time of communication the most important devices are going to be those that have to do with communication, the computer
0 Uh, whatever the handling of information and all that allows, right?
3 Yeah, 'cause, uh, there in Texas, yeah, but up there in Texas.
0 but
1 You guys need the car, you know, to, to work.
1 Yes
0 So...
0 exactly and here the working people have as if it were in those times like a mule, right? they need a one, a pick up one, truck pick up
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0 pick up truck, right? and give it up, and don't let them, so it's- this one, yeah you notice, like there's a very, very important heavy-duty culture.
0 Uh-huh.
1 And computers, well, in every house there's television, phone and computers practically, right? But like there are other dimensions, right? of the technological question, then the car seems to be
0 of the most important
1 Yes, but,, the questions on the subject were which
0 ah, what a- what technical, technological question is most important in your life? which is what we're discussing right now if it would have to be the car or it would have to be the computer, what do you think?
1 Well, for me it would be more my computer and my cell phone.
0 Uh-huh, exactly.
2 Because I have my cell phone and I'm always with him.
0 Uh-huh.
2 And, well, I've gotten used to having a cell phone, you know?
0 Uh-huh.
6 In the past, I didn't have a cell phone until I was about 20 years old, but now that I live in Philadelphia in the city and I'm not always in the house for...
1 I'm not always coming back to the house for, you know, seeing my messages.
1 Yeah, yeah.
3 Well I always stay, I always have my cell phone
1 You got your cell phone.
1 I think it's pretty amazing that almost everyone has a cell phone, here in the United States.
3 Yeah, look, yeah, that's very important what you just said, a long time ago when I was working, I had a kind of job where the computer was the most important thing, right?
1 Yes
1 And, well, on the computer were the messages, there was always the internet, the emails more than the phone, no cell phone or anything, right?
1 Yes
1 The computer was the most important thing.
0 But now
2 But now, with the kind of work I'm doing the car is the most important thing, the computer because the car is what allows you, re-e- the kind of work I'm doing is more
0 So the car becomes the most important device and the computer, so for the background, although it is also very important, right?
0 But it's because of the kind of good work.
4 Well for me I think, that well, you and, you were in Texas and obviously you know, there's more, ah, how do you say? I understand that there's more like estates and everything out there, you know?
0 much more space
1 Yeah, yeah.
0 by the, in the city having a car can be an inconvenience too
1 Yeah, yeah, that's right.
1 Because you always have to try to park and you have to pay a lot to park and, the gas station are not close and, I don't know is
1 It's more of a problem than a tor-- than a help, but obviously, you know, obviously.
0 Oh, yeah?
2 It's better to have a car, a- I think
1 Yeah, yeah, no, not here, yeah, because of the distances you have to travel at work, the car is fundamental.
0 Uh-huh. Sure.
1 But yes in, in the city I think so, the most important thing - and depending on the work also so, uh, it can be the computer, right?
0 the, the other question or, or the communication devices, right? as you say, the cell phone and
0 Uh-huh.
1 And that, and, uh, and the other question is, do you consider that these, uh, these technologies become more of a problem than, you know,
1 Well, what kind of problems you might have, right, like you just said, with the car, the problems that have to do with the parking lot.
0 Uh-huh.
2 There's not, there's not, where I'm not, there's no major problems, isn't there, with the parking lot there's a lot of space for all sides.
3 let's say, those problems here, but anyway, I don't know, I don't know what you think, more than anything else, I would say that, with regard to cars, automobile issues and all that, because it doesn't look like a big problem unless
1 We could consider as a problem the vested interests around the, of the automotive industry and as they sometimes seem to affect the same development of the technology of
0 transport, for example?
0 Uh-huh, but don't you think it's, too, that it's kind of magnificent that it's changed in, like, sixty years?
1 Yes
0 a- yes we look at how seventy-five years in the past there were no cars, but nowadays almost everyone has
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, yeah.
1 And the same thing with computers they have, they have computers that they won't let out in the market for up to, like, ten years, because
1 Well, then.
0 Because they already have the- very advanced things and things haven't cumbri- they haven't cum-
1 Yes
1 I don't know how to explain it very well.
2 Yes, as they also say, with the automotive industry, right? If the automotive industry had advanced technologically as much as the electronics industry could possibly transport us with
2 100 kilometers with a single liter of gasoline
0 Uh-huh.
2 And instead of costing you twenty thousand dollars, I'd be costing you two thousand dollars.
1 Yes
2 If that's the case, right? But, like technology, in this case industry, it has its interests, no, like it doesn't move forward, right? You see what they're saying now with hybrids.
0 that no, many of them say that they are not costable that in reality it is nothing more a question of image that the companies manage and when it comes to seeing the tables of, of returns
2 of hybrid cars because I thought they were going to be much more efficient I think that what they have achieved of efficiency is minimal
1 Yes
1 I don't think they have a real real one, this one that's really such a technological change very important given the efficiency that
1 Yeah, that was a big change.
0 Send?
0 don't you think it's a big change, or
1 No, I don't think it's that important all the time that the efficiency they show isn't radically different from that of the other cars, is it?
0 ah
0 One, a, according to the tables an economic car drives you can be thirty-six miles per gallon
0 Uh-huh.
1 And a hybrid can handle you fifty.
1 Ah no, oh yeah sure, of course, there are cars there now like the, the Fords.
0 Uh, so...
0 Not because they're changing them so they're more efficient, you know?
0 Uh-huh.
0 But, but the expedition and those huge cars and so they spend, you know, they can only walk like twenty miles, ten and eight miles a gallon something like that, that's a huge expense.
1 Yeah exactly and and sure, and but, at the same time with these cars on this one, there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance as hybrids, and they're not hybrids, right?
3 for, small cars, new ones that are not in the North American market, that are in the European or Latin American market where they have to be much more efficient
1 Ah, yes.
3 And smaller, right? then if we compare the costs of a hybrid against a small European cart, or of lso circulating in Latin America then
0 n- it's much more expensive to have a car so it's the initial cost and so it's going to save on gasoline, it ends
0 Being less than what a car has, a good economic car, isn't it?
0 and, why is it that
1 European
1 Why is it that the United States is one of the only nations that has this, that, only here you have those huge cars, you know?
1 Yeah, it's, yeah.
1 There in other countries they all have small cars that good, different, different culture, you know, but
4 Yes, I've been the oil problem for years, in the '80s or something, I don't remember.
0 Uh, uh-huh.
2 I thought there was going to be a change in culture, because they started, to develop smaller cars here in America.
1 Yes, but
1 I thought, well, there's going to be a change in culture, but that was just for the moment, right?
2 I'm Ana Maria.
1 Ah Faviola, hi
0 Hello, Faviola.
0 How are you?
0 Good and you, how's the weather out there in your house?
1 All right, either alone or cold.
1 Alone and cold, ah.
0 Cold
1 What do you think about the movies? Have you talked about this subject before?
1 Yes
1 I, too, had touched on this subject before.
3 I hadn't touched myself and I had to talk about the uh, specifically the person I had to talk to told me about the violence.
0 mhm
1 No, he liked the idea of going to see movies. I tell him, the world that is world.
0 mhm
1 He has always had, and I have the experience of teaching children to Puera peace and love on television or, or in the world and then when they face the real world that is school.
1 They find that, little children beat him, they don't know how to defend themselves, especially when you have unique children.
0 Uh-huh.
3 So, uh, I find that the sorting they have is okay, I think it's the responsibility of adults, as far as kids can watch TV.
1 I agree, the ultimate responsibility rests with the parents.
1 They're doing their job in the movies, and
1 They're earning their money, what's their job,
1 It's his business, you.
0 doing his business, yeah.
1 If now the one who wants it, you take, the one who wants to see it, does not want to see it is no longer their responsibility, they see
0 of, yes
1 That sells.
1 Yes
1 And it's what they do, it's not their fault, it's their fault.
1 Yeah, he likes the product in the background, that's why.
1 Yes
1 with you that is the ultimate responsibility, whether for violence, for sex, for whatever you want to protect, for, for a child. I think the greatest responsibility is for the parents, even if there is a classification.
0 Because there is a sorting of a movie for example ~PG thirteen
1 Yes
1 And you have a boy under that age and you let him watch the movie, it's your responsibility.
1 Yes
1 It's because you left it and thought it could be, isn't it?
1 Exactly.
1 So because I'm the, the, the association, or, or whatever it is that puts the, uh that puts the classifications already has it, so,
1 I think yes, notice that we think more or less the same about that Faviola because, at the end of the day, that the resuscitation of raising and caring and that you want me to see and not to see.
1 Your children, or your family, you as a mother or your husband as a mother.
3 I also think I'm totally okay with it and the other thing, usually kids have access to TV when parents are out.
1 Exactly.
1 The children are alone.
0 mhm
1 And there's not the dad to show him or tell him, this you shouldn't see this, you should see.
0 Or if they go to sleepover you don't know either.
0 Of course not, you have no idea.
1 If they go to a sleepover and put a movie on them, watch a movie or have no control in that house or whatever.
1 You don't know either.
1 Exactly.
1 I think the important thing is to give the children one, to respect those, to signal if you give them good principles in the house. One as a family, that is to teach them to, things,
0 Sure.
3 That I really don't like that, or because I don't like it, that you see it, or that you're not ready, or that the time is coming anyway.
1 What, because as they say, you can't have them in a glass box.
0 No, and besides
0 is, exposed or exposed
1 Yes No besides that when the children get to an age. My son was fifteen, seven-seven years old and he tells me Don't worry, because you did the best you could do.
0 mhm
0 ah, it's twenty-five percent of the genes and education and the rest is my decision, my decision of my life.
0 Look, with that thing
2 Sure, you know, I learned. Oh wait, no, oh, I was and
0 mm
2 Okay, okay, I'm quitting and I'm answering.
0 Okay.
0 Hey, don't cut me because we need to talk for 12 minutes.
1 Yes
0 He just went to pay for it.
0 Okay ah
3 And about people I believe from movies I love watching horror movies.
0 Right.
2 But there are times when I'm afraid I'm an adult.
1 You, you freak yourself out,
2 I'm scared and I'm gonna find out the horror movies.
0 But your responsibility is to see him, and you get scared yourself.
1 Yes
5 I don't like them anymore and I don't see them, I don't see any kind of them. That's why it's also my decision to even have the age to see them, if it's too aggressive, I don't want to see them.
3 Yes That's why I respect what my son told me that time, fifty percent is responsibility,
1 Yes
0 Of, of the individual, of the person, uh, you already did the best you could, but the age of the boys comes from before having eighteen to the.
0 that some are more mature than normal
1 Yes
1 And they start watching movies ~R
0 mm
0 a, the fourteen and fifteen years old and the ~PG thirteen are watching it.
2 Yes, I do.
3 And sometimes even kids, and sometimes more kids because I remember Jenny's little friend I saw, who sees Harry Potter and is
1 Ya thirteen ya
1 ~PG thirteen, ~pg fourteen and then I say, Jenny doesn't like it, she's scared.
0 Right.
0 He's scared of the mounstrous and all that.
1 Yes
3 But I do agree, that most of it is, the criterion that you form for him and so on. Take care of them if you don't want them to watch TV when they're alone.
1 Yes because, because
1 Don't leave them alone with TV.
0 But imagine you can't control them anyway.
0 But it's not you anymore.
2 That's why I'm telling you, you can control them, this movie you can't see for this and this reason, because you lack maturity or whatever you want to say, it's not true.
1 You have to have a trained criterion for and to watch movies.
2 Yeah, that's why I'm telling you, you don't get anything out of telling her, you can't see that, no.
0 Uh-huh, at the same school, he shows them movies.
0 Or the same school, but the same school is a little more supervised because that's something else because it goes, it goes for an end.
1 They teach you documentaries.
3 But I'm most afraid of him when he goes home to friends. And sometimes they have the TV right there on the foot, what's used so much, or the computer or whatever.
1 And they have access to information without the parents. no, nor the parents there have any idea. and they're in the room think the parents think they're listening to music or whatever.
1 Maybe they're seeing something wrong, so that's why I'm saying, that's what happens, is that if my daughter or my son or whatever,
1 He has to learn to value himself, and learn to respond to that, that's what I'm saying, that is, trying to give them the values of the house.
0 Go on like superman the little boy who climbed in the window and killed himself.
1 I, of course, because you know they're not ready yet.
1 No, I want to ask you a question.
0 Uh-huh.
0 Uh, you read the rules in this, uh, phone game.
1 Yeah. Okay.
3 Am I wondering, ah, how is this? Are you getting ready for Christmas already?
4 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm already getting ready, I'm already buying presents for the family, but now I'm with everything, with other things in mind.
0 Not for birthdays.
3 Yes, but I'm already preparing, buying presents for the family at least my nephews. I've got them ready, we've already bought the gifts, so there's no more big people left.
1 Buy big people something, an anxiety, anyway most of the gifts I'm going to make.
2 That's what I was gonna tell you.
2 I'm gonna cook. Yeah.
0 Cook and cook. Cook what you did, which you gave to me.
0 yes also for some children if also
0 Not that about the table.
3 Yes, the, the yes too, but I don't have time yet I have to wait until mid, until the last week of December to do so.
0 Oh, 'cause they're
1 Because I don't have time before.
1 That's nice.
5 Yes, so that's what I'm going to do too. That's why some gifts I'm going to make, but for example. am, the Andreite who's on birthday for example soon.
1 Two days before Miranda
1 Andreita's on birthday, too.
2 If it's twenty-five or twenty-four, I don't remember.
2 Oh, I do, but I remember it was like three days.
4 Three days then the twenty-four. So, I got him his little gift, I bought him the same thing I bought from Miranda.
1 And what did you get Miranda?
0 For the re-screen of those that draw and go erase.
0 Oh, that's nice.
1 Because he likes them, already, he knows them and likes them, he does scratches and then he erases them and I'm not going to give them to him yet because they're very young and he shoves them in his mouth.
0 But while the pencil and the screen do.
0 Oh, that's nice.
0 But you do because you're doing things like that.
1 What a thrill.
4 That's how I like to do it, so I bought the same thing from Andreita.
1 And you know who else is on birthday.
0 # Now who #
0 Same date
1 Who?
2 that I remember when I was there
0 My father-in-law,
1 Your father-in-law, yes.
2 Yes, it's true. Who?
1 El, el, Juan Luis, Sandra's youngest son.
0 Oh yeah ya
3 Also twenty-nine. I also remember, that about the same date, I remember that they were all on the same date.
2 I don't remember him being in I didn't know at least.
0 No, you went to Carlistos' birthday.
3 I haven't gone to any birthdays at Sandra's. I went to a pure one, I don't remember, really.
0 Not if you went once you went to Chile and left the gift, which was for the birthday,
3 Uh, it was April, so when I went to Chile it was April
0 Okay, that was another birthday, she's got three.
4 And there I left the reg- yes there I left the gift I
1 Yes for a nephew of hers who came later.
0 Of course he came, yes, he did tell me that later he had given it to him, yes.
0 No, but Sandra's not gonna be a birthday, she's not gonna be a party this year.
0 No, not okay.
0 He didn't say no to the family no more, because they're already going to buy him something better for the child, and.
1 Yes, it's true.
1 It's just that she actually throws too big a party, so,
0 He's going too far, yeah.
1 Too much, too much spending on it and they can't buy the child what,
1 What they really want, yes exactly.
3 They, of course. I know you have to decide between one thing or the other. Yeah so go, this year decided, the kid decided that he wants the family no more.
1 And to have a more special gift.
0 Sure, for one more present.
1 The Jua-Juan Luis is the largest or the smallest.
1 The youngest of them all.
1 Ah, yes, now.
2 And, and he says, I don't want any clothes.
0 Poor thing.
2 I don't want books. I just want toys.
0 Carolina
1 Tamara.
1 Tamara, how are you, uh?
1 Yeah, what about you?
0 Okay, well, where are you, uh?
2 I'm in Washington State, Seattle.
3 Wow, I'm in L.A.
0 Oh, yeah.
1 Yeah, it's amazing, right.
1 Yes
5 Right now I was making a call and a respite and I mean I didn't think that Sunday was half as sleepy as I was waking up and I... Oh, my God!
2 Yeah, I was caught off base, but you already have time to participate in this?
2 If this is it, I think this is my twenty-three call.
3 Wow you're almost ready, I'm going right in half I'm going for the tenth.
2 Yes, and this is the second time I've done the service with them.
1 Oh okay okay, yeah because I happen to get an e-mail that they're accepting people to remake the uh participate, because at first it was just once you could participate.
1 Yes
1 No, you got this same mail, didn't you?, so apparently this is going to continue you see. So I could understand in the mail they sent.
2 Yes, I am.
0 More like aha, tell me
0 So what do you think about what they put in the movies?
3 Well, I'm going to tell you honestly, I'm more than a year old than we've stopped watching movies in regular movies and we're going to the movies.
2 little " Conventional "
0 Uh-huh.
3 We go to the cinema, for example in the case of cinema, right? as in the case of television. Now we see films like Documentary East... Eh, with other kinds of messages so.
0 Uh-huh.
3 See movies that are in eh What's this called?, Festivals, here goes for example Recently ended the International Latin American Film Festival
0 Uh, yeah, it was.
0 yeah
1 Alo!
2 No, I'm not here on my computer, I'm sorry.
2 Ah, okay this about a month or less this month because for a lot of time as I tell you we decided we weren't going to waste any more time
0 time, in most cases they really are films of a rather silly absurd and good content and we took the decision because no, we didn't want to waste any more time or money
0 Okay.
1 I'm watching some kind of movies that really didn't lead to anything.
2 Yeah, 'cause there's enough movies like that, I've noticed.
1 Yes
3 Yeah, I like a, uh, around here where I lived before, there were some of this, uh, like Hollywood Video or Blockbuster, but it was like,
0 littleer.
0 Okay.
1 It was then they had movies just like the ones they're talking about ah documentaries and like that but they shut it down because since the big stores are always around people don't want to go to that,
0 Sure.
2 But those are the best, as you find movies I like yes, my husband is American but he also likes international movies, movies that have more
0 more important things to say
1 Exactly, exactly.
1 From time to time, since I have kids, sometimes they want to watch some movies and we take them but usually not, we have.
0 Uh-huh.
0 But now it's shortened, so this time once or twice every two months.
0 Okay, anyway, we were going about once a month but we were going a lot, a lot, a lot and a good day we watched a movie but so it's...
2 you know, so gaffy that I was upset about being in the movies, I mean, what are we doing here, what kind of time is it?
0 No, no no ; and we really started to get information from other types of movies and totally that we went completely into that; it's more right now we're in a
0 in a wave of those, that we're even half intellectual now but that's it, that's because it actually kind of got to that point, where you feel like:
5 What are you doing not? I mean to watch that, honestly, mind I prefer to go to bed and sleep or I prefer to do something else instead of, I don't tell you that all the movies, there are ones that have a
1 a rather uh different content, which is worth watching but lately I've felt like they're making movies, like making them.
1 Uh-huh. Exactly.
1 Aha, we kind of have to make ten movies; we're going to make ten movies but it doesn't matter.
1 Where are you from?
1 I'm from Panama.
1 Oh, okay. I'm from Venezuela.
0 Oh, okay.
1 Uh-huh. Yeah.
0 in, then it's true, it's true
3 We say that to the "Macha" no, like, if they make movies as they like, but if they do, some good ones come out, and others, if they don't come out, they don't come out.
3 And the same thing is happening right now with the TV, we had cable and now it's only a matter of a month ago we cut it because no, I don't know how to repenet
0 that we turned against that we saw that there was a lot of manipulation of the media only pass you the news that suits them hide the truth
0 Uh, so that's at the level of the news and the movies, so if you're not a very good movie really very good.
2 But then they repeat it and repeat it and repeat it. Oh, my God! What is this? We are paying for this then it is like a nuisance, right now we have as a nuisance with
1 With the media, we are reluctant, yes.
2 I'm here, my husband and I, we're watching news.
1 I think aha
0 Because every time you see something or they put something right stupid on you
0 exact
1 Either you've done it or they exaggerate quite a bit.
1 Exactly.
1 Because, when I was there, we were in Panama before Noriega left Panama.
1 Ay maginate
2 And we were there and my husband, you know, that white man, white paper compared to my dad is brown and my mom is white so I went darker than my dad, so
2 When Salians you knew he was American.
0 Logical, logical
2 We'd both get in, get in where we had to go, he had to go to work at the base and I had to go with him or something.
0 Of course.
2 We would come to the house and put on the television, if there were a little bit of things going on in Panama, I would look at him.
1 I don't remember seeing any of that over there.
0 exactly.
3 And the next day the same thing and I say: woe to ex-agent! I think they were teaching the thing that happened last week and exaggerating the thing so what
1 Exact-
0 Since then he's arrived no, he doesn't want to believe what television says.
1 Exactly.
1 the news none of that; that's what I tell my children don't believe everything that television says.
1 Exactly.
0 Because it's not true, and this
8 Look, I just happened to be loaned a movie called "La... Something like "La Deception de Panamá" or "La Defensión de Panamá"
0 Uh-huh.
3 This just when Noriega's problem and everything else was watching the whole documentary I stayed cold, because I never really imagined it would have been so sad and so
0 So ugly what happened
1 That was the documentary talking about the man who had taken his head off.
1 And oh yeah
1 I don't know.
3 notice that I don't remember with exact latitude I don't remember but... what I remember was that night when they bombed and so many people died this, even these days they passed a
0 a challenge to now the visit of the President here
0 Uh-huh.
0 was there and people were protesting that why? the current president did nothing to remind the victims of that sector
3 I think they were called Los de Richos, de Chinos The sector where practically all that town and I disappeared.
0 Oh, the churillo.
0 Uh, Del Chorrillo, exactly.
1 Where the police were, where the police were.
0 But in that one you say, look, they happen almost equally in Venezuela with the current president.
3 that happened a long time ago; then they put them here in Venezuela is happening and I don’t know what. Tarado, the other day I wrote to one of the journalists of
2 of Univisión. That they were not so brazen, that they did not put some things there that were not really people the first thing that tells you: hey! And that president
2 And I don't know how much, that's a madman, not what's going on is that they're distorting the, the information in such a way that they put it to you that it's a moustro, a dic-
0 But it's his personality, he's got a personality that
2 It's unusual and then people don't accept that. And it's a person who isn't ordinary, who isn't common and people don't accept that, so he's even the first to criticize all that.
1 Yeah, that's right.
2 And, uh, well, I don't know if you've heard it.
3 No, no, because like I tell you, I don't get in there with that news stuff, I don't get in there much, every once in a while.
1 Of course, look there is a page on the internet that you can watch TV from all countries including of course Panama is called
1 He sees you four all over, like TV four all over.
1 - TV.
0 four all
2 Yes Theatre.
0 four is a number four.
0 Uh-huh.
1 - TV number four all
2 -TV or TV for all
0 exactly, exactly there you go.
0 with
0 is dot com if
0 Okay.
4 There you see the programming of all the channels all the channels of the world then is of course Panama and this Venezuela. And there now I, now I watch the television of Venezuela.
1 But I specifically see the government channel over there, the national channel, because the other channels are from the opposition, so of course it's a little bit more of the same.
1 But I like to see it to see what barbarities they're saying.
0 Okay.
5 Then I compare it and since I have this website now I no longer turn on TV. Now we are there but stuck with the internet watching the channels of the
0 of everyone a little bit like to compare you see, which is what is happening and we are even doing it with the radio we are listening community, radio that you feel that you are
3 You are truly telling the truth or at least the other side of the coin let's not say it's the truth 100 percent because sometimes it's not
3 I mean, I don't know, but I can't say that all the others say isn't but
0 Uh-huh.
1 You're being manipulated too much.
1 Yes
1 I don't know if you
0 Hello?
2 I don't know if you saw a movie here called Auto fox.
1 No, maybe, but I don't remember.
1 That's a documentary that worked on Fox News.
0 mhm
1 And well they practically forced them to say what it wasn't and then they decided to give up the channel and apart from quitting they all joined together and started doing it as a level protest.
1 So at the, uh, local level to tell the world what was going on in Fox News. It’s very interesting, it’s called something like
6 "The Fox Workers Who Are Out"
0 some
0 Kind of outside.
0 Uh-huh.
0 Fox News
0 My name is
0 Hi, my name is Fernanda.
0 Hi Fernanda, how are you?
0 How are you...
0 Okay, where are you talking about?
1 of Washington
1 Ah, which one?
1 Washington, ~DC
1 Uh, yeah because, then, I think there's two, right?
2 Yeah, Washington State.
0 ah, ya and the other
1 Where are you, where are you from?
4 If I'm here in Idaho state, I don't know if you know him.
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
2 Yeah, this one, because I actually a lot of that stuff about movies, the truth, a lot of things, um for my point of view really don't really go along with me because then
1 They don't know how to classify them very, very well. Uh, for example, then sometimes they say it's ~PG and then uh, you see that movie and really
2 It's pretty rude and, and, and pornography. that sometimes one later for example ~PG thirteen sometimes it's more, I don't know, it's quieter.
2 And it doesn't have as many things as nudity or rudeness. To me, ah those classifications for me don't, like sometimes it doesn't.
2 You don't know, people who criticize those movies don't, they don't know how to qualify or, or I don't know what your point of view is.
2 Yeah, the truth is I don't know much about movies because
0 Uh-huh.
2 Say, I don't have kids or anything like that, so I almost never realize
0 Uh-huh.
1 What, what sort.
0 Uh-huh.
2 But I think most TV there is, let's say if you watch during the half-day that's when many times the kids are in the house
0 Uh-huh.
0 are things that are not appropriate for the majority.
1 Yes
4 And I think the Americans have, uh, not-- like moral standards have come down, you know what I mean?
1 Yes
2 A lot of things are like normal that I think shouldn't be.
3 Yeah, yeah it's true because, uh, and it's true because, uh, once, well, I don't have cable I have, the normal channels, the ones looking at each other
0 Uh-huh.
3 But for example, I got to have a, a cable time and sometimes it was, then, what do you like? 10 in the morning, eleven, and because I like to be changing the channel
1 to be choosing my program that I'm going to see in that ra- in that time
0 mhm
3 And sometimes they do movies that really, uh, yeah a ten-year-old or nine-year-old kid was at home and I was watching him, I was also changing him at the same time as me and
1 I stop on that channel, there were things but very, very old.
0 Of course.
8 So I said, uf, I said I thought about the kids, I said, well, I, I'm married, I'm three years married and I have a, a child of almost two years.
0 Okay.
0 Maybe my son's gonna grow up and maybe this is gonna go on for the worse.
0 Of course.
5 Imagine later what kind of cartoons are going to- well I remember I was once watching TV. Look, in Mexico, I'm from Mexico City.
0 mhm
1 It was ten o'clock at night exactly, ten o'clock at night.
2 to the channel that is here the ten and six, then was a cartoon in English because already the night they spend some in English, some in Spanish
3 Then I left him. And, cr- my mom was quiet because she was watching a caricature channel.
1 Well, the little monkeys started getting naked.
0 ah
1 And the monkey was starting to do his stuff, the two dolls, and it was cartoon, imagine, and it was ten o'clock at night, my mom told me.
1 What a horror.
2 He turned my TV off and then he had to explain to me a little bit because my mom didn't, no, he was surprised because I had put on a cartoon channel, a normal channel.
0 So, the truth is, even cartoons are no longer saved.
2 Yeah, and that could happen to, let's say, any kid who was watching TV.
0 Sometimes cartoons do.
2 And you can't be on top either. Let's say if kid changes, you can't jump to see. I mean, you have to trust that, let's say, at least during the day.
1 Yes
0 programming is neither nudity nor rudeness or anything like that.
0 But it's not really the caricatures, Japanese caricatures are the ones that rank the most, uh, they have.
1 In Cablevisión and Multivisión, which would be what cable here ta-ah, there in Mexico, does not have so many restrictions. But, for example, in normal televisions, of normal channels
2 if you have more, more restrictions. Eh not so much on the other cables. and, for example, on TVs, for example, normal children's ca-channel
1 TV like that, any channel, the, channel, for example it's the five in cartoons
1 Yes
1 For example, then he arrives at ten o'clock at night, eleven o'clock and you can watch TV and you don't get such ugly shows like that.
0 in Mexico District, mhm
0 But for example, if you're watching a cable channel, you're already risking that the cartoon might be from some of the times.
0 Pornography thing or even more nudity.
10 I-I-I-I-I-I-I see, I'm Colombian, and I think that in Colombia, I tamp-
0 So, uh-huh.
1 TV is much better than here in that sense.
0 Uh-huh.
0 Because, you know, it can happen, let's say ten o'clock at night, and the programs they give are never that bad, you don't risk them being as bad as they are here.
0 Uh-huh.
2 It's more here, neither at ten nor at any time. You're risking to see anything.
3 Yeah, yeah it's true the other one, well, I was with a neighbor, imagine I was with a neighbor, it was twelve, twelve and a half of the day.
1 So your boy was watching uh, the caricature channel and then the girl came up with changing him to TV and em- and it was another channel that was also scheduled to stop them, for kids.
2 Well there was a program where I was, where there was one, a girl who spent the adventures of a girl and that was, that in a hospital
1 And suddenly it happened right there from the hospital and they were already going on about how, how his mom was having her little brother.
0 Oh, yeah?
2 Uh-huh, but he looked and I grabbed him and I said, to his mom about her and she said ah, no problem, it's a channel of
3 And honestly I was, no, they didn't leave much to the imagination. I was really like the pose of, well because it was an operating room where the woman was having her baby.
1 What a horror.
1 They were, they're six years old.
1 Yes
0 Because they're twins, he's, uh, they're both six years old, and his mom was letting them see that, well every, every, every parent lets them see what
2 But honestly to me- if I don't want to explain tnto my children at that moment, then honestly I kind of watch more than,
0 So what you see, right? in that way. But, uf.
1 Yeah, imagine when, let's say, there's babysitters and stuff, so you don't have center and you're not in the house to see.
0 Mm-hmm.
1 They don't know what they're seeing, go to friends or anything.
0 yes no
1 I think
1 Yeah, it's one of those, you'll see those classifications that happen.
1 They don't leave anything to my imagination anymore, they already show it to you.
1 Yes
2 Any time of the day, you see one of those soap operas, I don't like watching soap operas.
0 How much mo- mom is home and has her little kids three, four years, five or more or they're in the house and they see, they're watching their soap opera
1 And there are always scenes where the, a couple, are having sex.
0 mhm
1 And in the middle of the day, because soap operas then pass from l- six in the morning until dark.
0 Of course.
1 Then they leave nothing to the imagination.
0 No, me.
2 So, already the programs are already classified, and seeing a porn scene on TV at any time of the day is normal. And already for many
0 parents are unfortunately becoming normal to them.
0 exact
3 And I think that if the parents talked to that TV set and they'd say that or they'd demand that they be programs as strict as, without scenes, of that kind of scenes.
1 I think he'll get a little down, but no more, not even parents, and if your kids see something like that, okay, no problem.
1 They don't care, mhm.
1 And then, those sorting things for me don't like them, and producers don't care about me.
1 If a movie has a sex scene or has rudeness for people to buy it or for people to see it and even laugh at it,
0 Or sometimes it even catches his eye because it has a very strong scene. So really already, those things sometimes even help them more.
0 producers to sell.
0 sometimes, and
2 So, no. Uh, me in particular, me the kind of movies I like, the truth is I really like Disney movies,
1 I like them.
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5 Although already, I'm already married and all that I love. I have some other movie here from, from Disney. I honestly don't like movies.
2 I'm going to have more kids and eventually I'm not going to be and
1 And at least if they're going to put on a movie, then make it a decent movie at least.
0 Sure, sure.
1 That as we go to Disney time, maybe they're gonna have porn, right?
0 if you don't know how they're going to change
1 No, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, actually this, this is getting the truth pretty far, you go, you turn on the TV, and if you want to see a commercial,
0 women's towels and it looks good until almost they're going to explain to you there how, eventually they're going to put a naked woman and they're going to
0 put in there how you're placing the towel.
0 exact
1 I don't know if you've seen the commercials, so maybe it doesn't scare you because you're already big, right?
0 But if a boy or a girl is seeing him for example and you say if the mother is there and you can answer her well, and if there is a friend or friend
1 And you tell him- and he can explain bad information then,
2 And that you get used to yourself, you know what I mean?
3 Then I'll- - Yeah.
2 Like I sometimes see and I kind of don't realize how things have changed.
0 Good night, my name is Mariza of Philadelphia.
1 Hello Hello my name is Juan You are Marisol.
0 Mariza, Mariza.
1 Maybe already for Mariza, we already talked like a few days ago I think, no.
0 Oh, chin, maybe yes,
3 Maybe, I'm in San Antonio, Texas.
2 In San Antonio, yes.
0 So the subject today is e, the question of religion, no.
1 Yes, which is a very complicated and very controversial issue.
2 Well, exactly, like the need for religion is something that we all have, I guess.
0 mhm
1 And that like all needs, institutions try to,
1 Yeah,
1 And it ends up being a form of control, no.
2 Ah, if really today in this country. Eh, in the United States there is also a lot, a lot of problem with religion, which is mixed with politics and many right-wing people who are the ones who want to control.
2 They try to control the country based on religion too and, It can be positive or it can be negative for many people, because it helps to pray or believe in something, it helps them and others, in others, of others.
0 Otherwise, the, the, the Christians is the most powerful religion in the world and they are the ones who, let us say, have the most power to influence politicians, countries.
3 If you notice that in this case, for example here where I live, I once went to a church.
0 mhm
1 That, well, they represented a whole project of, ideological, but that, flat out, they are one of the most conservative groups in the United States, no.
0 Mhm, yeah.
1 Then they exercised a very, very direct, very clear power, trying to influence people there in the church.
1 Yes
2 In the sermon, above all, I was struck by a lot of attention against public school.
0 mhm
0 directly against public school and prayed that God would free us from public school one day.
0 Really?
0 Because yes,
0 ah ah, no
1 And against the theory, that they try to see the theory of evolution, no.
1 So, that's what I heard, yes.
0 No, terrible, they said why is he harassing the teachers who teach the Bible to explain the creation of the world?
1 Exactly, yeah, there's a lot of trouble, yeah.
1 For the train takes me, for I say, for it is that, with all reason, the Bible does not make an explanation of the world.
0 Not everyone can believe whatever happens is that they try to in- impose their belief on everyone and be the Bible, let them be the people.
1 Exactly, they're fundamentalisms, no.
2 Yes Fundamentalism, yes, yes on the right. But it is also that the country is, uh, The power has it the party to it, that everyone from the president to all those who are involved in it, in the white house are all right conservative.
0 whites of, uh, Christians and who are the ones who people with power in country, the ones who have businesses, everyone is, just like, they are many conservative right-wing fundamentalist people who want to take away the law.
1 The right to abort, the right to, for example as another question was, homosexuality, gay marriages, the right to the belief of
2 Yes, more scientific no, no We don't have to believe just what they say, they say God created man and woman, but also give a choice for children to believe,
0 Charles Darwin was the theory of evolution.
1 Yes
3 And it's very complicated too, about, the other question was about homosexuality, yes, yes.If we were all the same or we believed the same, there wouldn't be problems like that, I asked.
0 But
2 Well, I think maybe the more similar we are, the more trouble we are, the more we don't.
1 Yes
1 In that sense, differences help to complement.
1 Sure, me, I don't have any,
1 The subject, the subject of homosexuality is very controversial,
0 mhm
1 But at a certain point, it's not a, let's go, like tolerance the phenomenon of homosexuality should be something, that, that in which we're pretty well informed, no, I personally for example before thought that,
2 It could be a deviation, homosexuality, but lately I have read that they also have a question, a genetic burden.
4 If I, I'm convinced that's because I know a lot of people who are,
0 No
3 Well, gays, or lesbians and, I'm very informed and then that's if I don't always know why.
3 Like I accepted people for, I didn't think they were either better or worse because they were homosexuals and that everyone has the right to, because I don't know, to get married, to,
1 Well, yeah,
3 I don't care, I don't care, and I think he has the same rights because they're equal citizens, and they pay their same taxes.
1 Yes
1 They have to have the right to marry, to live with anyone.
3 Yes I do agree with you, exactly I think, they have all the rights, because we can have any other kind of people and in this case, with the rights related to marriage.
0 because many handle the question of homosexuality as a very, very perverse question and that they have no right to marriage, not when it is a question - when marriage is actually a contract.
0 mhm
0 between two people who decide to do something in common.
0 Sure, but the church doesn't see it that way.
0 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1 He thinks it's an abomination because marriage defines it as a union between a man and a woman and they believe it, and people and Christian fundamentalist devotees as I said before see that as an abomination, and they're so closed that they don't understand that.
0 that maybe was before, the traditional way of thinking but now the times are changing and each one because it is, just like before, homosexuality has always been, from the beginning of man what happens is that before there was a way and now so,
4 You go, you don't get things more liberal, let's say, and people aren't afraid to say it anymore, because I'm gay, or I'm gay or I'm whatever it is.
1 That's the problem, that the church has a problem, but they can't do anything because
0 Uh-huh.
0 People are accepting the fact that people, if you look at him he's gay, yes and yes. Very well.
0 Of course there is one that is very extreme that, uh, the family and marriage, the ecclesiastical institution and God's blessing for marriage and things when actually.
0 because church and religion is a form of institution, it is just like school, it has
0 Sure.
0 the need first to change and find new, new ways to learn the things of life.
1 Yes
0 From society and individuals, no.
2 If religion would have to be something personal, not something that mixes with politics everyone can, the, what they think, what they believe is everyone's, doesn't have because I know,
3 Well, look because you don't think the same as I do, don't be the same as I am, so, like, punish them for not being equal, and it's not that, everyone can think what they want, believe in whoever they want or whatever they want, they don't have,
0 for Christians, because they speak evil of Muslims because they say they are radical or speak evil of those, of atheists because they do not believe in God and call them heretics or,
1 But I don't know,
0 Uh-huh.
1 That is not very Christian if so, you have to accept people as they are, and everyone who believes or has their religion, but that is the problem of fundamentalists, who do not accept differences.
1 Yeah well, but in that case, accepting differences seems to be something that has to do with a matter of humanity, no.
0 mm
0 Like it's a paradox not being able to accept the difference they think but, uh-huh.
1 What happens is that yes, it is that in this country children when they are, those families, Christian families that, right, let's say that children are raised in a way that, since they are little children they teach them that it has to be so, and so, and so, then,
1 When they are older and know people who are different because they say, that is not it, because they taught me that it is so, and so, and so and so they have to be
1 You know they're very radical, no, they don't accept the differences because they were raised in a way that their parents taught them, then.
1 Yes
2 I, for example, was lucky enough to travel a lot to meet people of many races, of many cultures, so I am open to everything.
0 Uh-huh.
8 And that's why when I see a person who isn't, I know right away, just by looking I say there is, this person, he won't accept me because I'm not like her, I'm not, I don't think alike, I don't look the same.
1 But there are classes there are many people of all kinds and, and there must be radical Christians there must be everything, but I believe that yes, and that if there is much influence on the country, religion, yes.
0 Uh, yeah, it influences quite a bit, what amazes me most is that in this case,
1 Yes
1 In this country, be so fundamentalist, no.
2 If I are
1 With the churches, there is a good proportion of fundamentists even in the president's own speech there are fundamentalisms,
0 Sure, yeah, yeah.
0 Not there,
1 The message is very clear and it is already five years of government, and when Bill Clinton was in the government because, he was not so, he was more open let's say, of course he was leftist, more open-one more person.
1 that I understood things more to people and, this government let's say that it is carried by the For that, the, the religious right-wing Christians or those who are
0 saying how things are done in the country and that is why there is so much controversy with marriages is also with those, with the supreme court with, with, the judges who want them to be right-wing also and to be good religious,
1 Whether they are Catholics or whatever they are they also want, to take away the right to abortion and things like that, which is, is ridiculous at this time of the century.
0 Uh-huh.
1 That, like, they want the thing to go back, to go back instead of going forward, they want it to be like thirty or forty years ago and that doesn't mean it.
0 But, so we are now.
0 Uh-huh, and do you have, uh, practice any religion on particles?
3 I in my family are from, in Spain I am cat- catolism let's say is how much you are born because they baptize you, the first communion and all that, because I married for the church.
0 Sure.
6 I think, well, I have my belief, but I don't go to church, to mass every Sunday, or practice, you know, I don't practice, I am, I think.
2 But let's say I'm taking it on my own, let's say the fella is with me, I'm not.
1 Yes
6 nor, nor am I, that is, I am very open, that is, it is contradictory that I am a believer, I am a Catholic, but I am not know, I am not a foundation.
3 Yes It happens to me the same and when sometimes I have a rapprochement with the Catholic Church, it is almost temporary because they are so you say hear where there is a sense of integration, of community here there is,
0 vested interests in all seem
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a lot of economic interest, yeah.
0 No, then.
1 That's the problem, you see right away they're not interested in parishioners, they're interested in money, and
1 Yes
1 And neither are they seen to be very believers, there have been many cases of, of child abuse and so on, of child abuse.
2 That you hear, and you question, and how this can be possible. That a... a priest does this to a child and, there's a lot of controversy about that.
1 Yes
1 But, let's say that faith, it's each one, I don't know that everyone is free to believe what they want and, to practice it, but respecting others who are not the same.
0 Uh-huh.
0 Because there are many religions and what happens is that the Christian religion is the most abundant in the world, it is the most, the one that carries the power of everything.
2 For in the world that has touched us, on this side of the world no, because I think no longer believe that it is even the majority of Christians, I believe that there are more Muslims than Christians.
1 Yeah, but they don't have that much economic power, that's the problem.
0 mhm
0 Hello, good night.
1 Yeah, good night.
0 Good night, my name is Carolina.
0 Oh, how are you, Carolina?
1 How about Alex?
1 L.A.

1 Uh-huh. Yeah.
1 Oh, oh, I think Hispanics here are, like, ninety-five percent Mexicans.
1 Yeah, sure, uh-huh.
1 Yeah.
1 Yes, because tonight's topic is technical equipment.
3 Yeah, I use, I use computers.
1 Yeah.
2 And ah, I got the ~D~S~L fast now.
0 Mhm.
4 Yeah, I love it because I like it on the internet fast, I don't like waiting for pages
1 Yeah, uh-huh.
2 So for me it's very useful because I'm looking for a job, I'm doing a search for women.
0 Mhm.
2 Mm-, a lot of things and, and I don't like to wait for the, the pages, you know what I mean?
1 Yeah, uh-huh.
3 I like to do it fast and, and before that, when I was when I had the line, over the phone
1 Yeah.
1 It was very slow.
0 Very slow, yes.
1 So I had to wait about two or three minutes just to pop up one, one page.
1 Yeah, sure.
2 And so far, I have webcam and, and the webcam comes out fast with the ~D ~S ~L
1 Yeah, sure.
1 The webcam is when they can see you ah, like tele-, co-, conferences video conference
0 Mm. Mhm.
1 It's fast.
0 Mm, yeah, sure.
1 And you?
4 Well, for me, too, of course and I take it down, my tra-, I'm an administrator and then uh, my job I use it and for me the computer, so
0 the most essential, and especially eh, and in the new techniques, right? the new technology that has come and every day there are newer things coming out, right?
1 Yeah.
3 So, the truth is that I've adapted very well and I've loved it since I've been using the computer, because this one before the typewriter was used, which was so slow for
0 writing documents and forms, and everything, now everything is done through the computer and the internet, right? So it's a wonderful thing.
3 For me, it's essential, I think I don't know what I could do without the computer, right?
0 Moving on more and more every day, isn't it?
1 Mm, sure, I think, have, e-, have made more a- computer advances than they've made in, with medicine.
1 It's true.
1 The computer is the most advanced of civilization now.
0 Uh-huh, yeah, and for everything, right?
1 Yeah.
3 you want to find it there and then when you sit in the good one, I use it for my job, but, well and when I'm in the house and I need
2 Some information, because I sit on the computer and there's no one to stop me, I don't know, that when you're already like something, you're an essential part of one's life, right?
1 Yes, exactly.
0 For everything, because if you need to know how the tempered rages, then it goes to the computer.
0 News, sports.
1 It used to be yes, mhm.
1 Ah, outings with women, everything.
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1 No, and until this encuestra we're doing now I found it on the computer as well.
0 Oh, too, yes, oh.
1 Yeah, almost mm, so computer has a lot of influence.
1 Yeah, sure, and how many calls have you already made?
1 Twenty-two, this is my, uh, twenty-two call.
0 Oh, and, uh, you're already finishing up then.
4 I'm almost there, I'm missing about three but u-, a call that the person spoke more in English then me, it seems to me that I'm going to have to replace it.
0 Oh, now, now.
0 Pe-, but who knows?
1 Yeah, uh-huh.
1 Because I spoke in Spanish, then you must tell.
0 Mm, now.
1 Because if you speak English, no, they don't.
0 But you get paid after you finish the twenty-five calls, right?
1 Yeah, you make a, a replacement call.
1 Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2 I went to talk to him, I know the owner of this.
0 Oh, yeah?
3 And, and I'm gonna ask him if I have to replace him.
0 Oh, ah, you know the owner?
1 Yeah.
0 Oh, that's good.
1 Yeah, it's easy, it's easy to talk to him.
1 Ah, is he from over California?
0 No, he must be in Philadelphia.
0 Oh, now, now, now.
0 But, but he gave me the tele-
0 Oh, but do you know him personally?
0 No, no, no, no.
1 Ah, only through the computer
2 Yeah, I know him through the computer, but he
0 through the internet, now, uh-huh.
0 But he, he talks to the people who are participating.
1 Oh, yeah, yeah? Oh, no, I've never talked to him, me.
1 Yeah, so if you have any questions you can, he's a Chinese.
0 Oh, yeah?
2 Yeah, well, I don't know if he owns it, it's the
0 Oh.
0 He, the manager.
1 Yeah.
1 Yeah, that, for-, supervisor of, of the project they're doing.
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1 Yes, and they're studying how we speak Spanish.
1 Yeah, right, and
2 I don't know, if I-if you knew.
3 Yeah, yeah, I knew, and besides, yeah, I think they're gonna start another one after you finish this one.
4 No, I don't know, but as much as possible, because I, I've- - I've already done two.
0 Mhm.
1 One in English and one in Spanish.
0 Oh, this is your second, oh, yeah?
2 Yeah, and this is what we're doing right now. It's technology.
0 Oh. Oh.
0 Because they're making connections over the phone.
0 Oh, and the other one was the same, too, twenty-five calls?
3 And this is theology. Yeah, something like that, it was the same thing, but it was in English.
1 Yeah, and you got paid, too, anyway?
1 And they paid the same.
0 Oh, now, now.
2 Yeah, I like to do this because not just for the payment, but they give me the chance.
0 Oh, that's good.
0 to speak in Spanish
0 Sure.
1 Because it's the u-, the only time I speak Spanish.
0 Mm, now.
3 I, I speak very little Spanish now, it's more my day is English.
0 Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
1 Yeah.
1 Yeah.
2 And what more theology do you use? This what we are doing now is technology.
1 Sure, I'm sure you do.
3 This couldn't be done about 20, 30 years ago what we're doing now.
1 Exactly, uh-huh.
0 because they are using multiple phone lines to connect many people who live in different parts of the country.
1 Exactly.
3 I think phone technology, they've made advances too because I can already make long distance calls and I'm not worth anything because you pay
0 ah, a monthly fee
0 Uh-huh.
1 And you can make all the calls you want.
0 Oh, but here in
1 And that wasn't a- that wasn't like that five or ten, twenty years ago.
2 Of course, I mean, here in America.
1 Here in America, yes.
2 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I just got an ah, from Verizon that they're offering me to make all the calls for free here in America.
1 Yeah.
1 And they give me and while and they charge me.
1 They do charge you something monthly, but if you make a lot of calls, it's worth it.
1 Yeah, sure.
1 And you know what, someday they're gonna do it internationally, too, to their favorite country.
0 Oh, that was good.
1 You pay a monthly fee, and you can make any calls you want.
1 Yeah, uh-huh.
1 Yeah.
2 Good thing it was, isn't it? Yes, oh, it would be great to call the country, so when you want I think it's going to hurt, because with the cards too, right?
2 It used to be expensive. Do you remember before? To call the country of
1 And it's cheaper, right?
0 Now it's really cheap, of course.
1 And why is it cheap?
1 That, of course, yes, yes.
1 Yes, technology.
0 Now you can talk three four or five hours for five dollars.
1 Exactly.
0 Before it was a minute, oh my god was like eight.
0 One minute was twenty cents, yes.
4 And yeah, I remember I had to talk, I think ten minutes was all, it cost me like twenty-five dollars.
0 Mm.
3 And I had to take care of myself with the clock ahead, didn't I?
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that happened to me, too.
1 Yeah, uh-huh.
2 Yes, yes, yes, ah, I know what yes, what it is, it has to be with the clock.
0 Oh, yeah.
1 Yeah, but uh, with, with
4 Yeah, I've had, that the truth that, I hope that technology continues to advance, I say about ten years from now, what else will they get out, right?
0 Because as this has to go forward, right?
1 What happens is that as it is advancing and and technology is already in the hands of, more people
0 Mhm. Mhm.
0 then the services are cheaper, because they sell to more people
0 Na- Sure, yeah.
0 Do you understand me?
0 Mhm, cla-
0 Uh, for example, it's the computer, the computer five years ago, it was worth about two, two or three thousand dollars.
1 Exactly, yes.
1 Today buy a computer for two hundred or three hundred dollars
0 Oh, yeah, that's right, uh-huh.
0 Because there's, there's more demand.
0 Now of course, of course, aha.
0 Because there's the technology was, it's advanced.
0 Oh, yeah, that's right.
2 What I'd like to see
1 Yeah.
0 More advanced technology, it's with medicine.
0 Mm.
1 You have to look for cures like ah, cancer, uh, if you can go to the moon, why can't they look for a cure for cancer?
0 Right.
0 super fast computer you can think of, why can't they find a cure for cancer?
0 Mm. Mm.
2 I want to see more progress in disease, I think they're going slow in that area.
0 Mm, now.
1 I haven't seen much progress in, in disease in the last ten, twenty, thirty, forty years.
0 Mm. Mm.
0 Good.
1 It's true, because cancer is how old it is.
1 Yeah, how many people, right?
1 And they don't find him a cure, do they?
1 And that shortens a lot of people's lives.
1 A-yeah, yeah, yeah.
0 Or, or heart disease too.
2 AIDS, now that it's so widespread in so many places.
2 AIDS is more advanced than cancer, in
1 Well, that's it.
0 in the sense of controlling because they already have drugs to fight it.
1 Yeah, yeah.
1 But the cancer is very slow, I think.
0 Mm, now.
0 Have you heard a cancer discovery?
0 No, no, no, no, it's true.
0 Nothing.
0 Uh-huh.
0 Very slow.
1 Yeah.
1 They could get better at that.
0 Okay, sure.
1 Yeah.
1 I hope something comes up that God will enlighten you, so you can find something that can, uh, cure, stop this catastrophe that's when cancer comes, no matter how old it is, but it's coming, isn't it?
1 Yeah, yeah.
1 Which presents itself in anyone.
2 I, I had a friend who died young, at thirty-two and gave her cancer overnight.
1 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0 and died in three days.
0 Oh my god in three days?
1 Yeah, 'cause he gave her a brain bleed.
0 Oh my god.
1 And, and he died immediately, he had luki- leukaemia, of the, of the blood.
0 Oh, yeah.
1 And of that, he gave her that overnight.
0 Oh my god.
1 And they couldn't do anything to him, no.
0 Mm.
0 No, no, uh...
